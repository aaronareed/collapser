Guidelines
	- Syntax should be easy to type, and minimize control characters.
	- The smallest amount of variation is a word: don't waste time making versions with alternate punctuation. Also don't do minor variants like dialog tags.
		- A good metric to shoot for is only have a variant when it's interesting. Avoid minor imperceptible variations.
	- No nesting (to prevent wasting time on sub-probabilities of sub-probabilities). Every alternative is either seen or not.
	- Think extremely hard before using a probability less than 10.

Collapser should:
	- Track each usage of control characters across multiple runs. When the usage has changed, either internally or the ~50 characters before/after, have the user confirm it by showing all the possible variants in context (including author-pref). (Key is position + contents).

Problems:
- What if we have a macro where the author-preferred way is to expand it one way some times and another way others?
- Copy/paste from OO:
	- Fix paragraph breaks
	- Find italics/other formatting
	- Elipses. Replace … with Latex version.

** Basic Formatting:

Wrap text in asterisks for italics, as in markdown.

	"I already *told* you..."

Two dashes for em-dash; might as well allow — since this prints the same. (Note Latex is triple dash). (Actually, maybe should find/replace this, since it's visually hard to distinguish from a normal dash.) 

	Look--Peter--the thing is...

Write extended Unicode characters directly.

	Dvořák

Line break by ending line with \\ (same as Latex).

Smart quotes? Putting " doesn't do them right. Manually use “ ” ? Collapser catches " ?
' or ’ in didn't works, but must use ’ and (other).

** Basic Syntax:

Control characters should never be ones that would appear in the manuscript. So far they are:
	[ ] Begin and end a control sequence.
	{ } Macro/format block
	|	Divide alternatives
	*	Bold formatting
	>	Conditional text
	@	Indicates a variable	
	^	Author-preferred
	#	Comment
	~	Always print this block.
	/	Split params in formatting block

Start a line with a # for a comment to be stripped/ignored.

	# This is a comment.

The basic format is to specify pipe-separated alternatives wrapped in square brackets. The below will randomly print "alpha", "beta", or "gamma".

	[alpha|beta|gamma]

It's valid to have an empty option: the below will print "alpha" or nothing randomly.

	[alpha|]     => this is the same as [alpha]

The "author's preferred version" is assumed to be the first one listed. When this is not possible, it can also be indicated with a ^ immediately proceeding the content. "Output author-preferred" is a flag that can be set in Collapser; the code also has a slight preference for the author-preferred version (maybe 25%).

	[alpha|^beta|gamma]   (or, better):    [beta|alpha|gamma]
	[|alpha|beta]		=> author's preferred version is to print nothing

If there is just a single item, it will either randomly print, or not. Use ^ if printing is author-preferred, omit if not.

	[alpha]		Print "alpha" randomly (or never when author-preferred)
	[^alpha]	Print "alpha" randomly (or always when author-preferred)

If you preface a single block of text with ~, it will always be printed. (This is useful for macros.)

	[~alpha]	Always prints "alpha"

Nesting is not allowed, though you can get around that a bit using a macro. A tag can span potentially dozens of paragraphs. 


** Probabilities

You can preface an alternative by an integer between 0 and 99 and a > sign to give a percentage chance that version will be chosen. If the values add up to < 100, show nothing the other percent of the time. It's invalid for values to sum to > 100. If one alternative uses a number, they all must. The author-preferred indicator should go on the token, not the number

	[80>alpha|10>beta|10>^gamma]
	[50>alpha]  => (equivalent to "[alpha]")


** Variables

You can define a boolean variable, which always starts with @, by starting your line with the reserved word DEFINE (caps matter). This will be randomly set to true or false, unless you give it a probability. Author-preferred goes before the @ (which is part of the variable name). 

	[DEFINE @wordy]    => randomly true/false, or never true if author-preferred
	[DEFINE 80>@wordy] => @wordy is true 80% of the time, or never if A-P.
	[DEFINE 10>^@wordy] => @wordy is true 10% of the time, or always if A-P.

Variables can contain letters, numbers, -, or _ and can't start with a number. Prefer camelCase.

You can also define an enum variable by specifying multiple options numerically: these must always add up to 100.

	[DEFINE 50>@wordy|50>^@taciturn]

Restrict text to showing only when a defined variable is true. Note that it's a mistake to indicate author-preferred here: that's set by the variable.

	[@wordy>he said loquaciously] 

Can specify an else by providing one other alternative, which can be empty.

	[@wordy>he said loquaciously|he summarized] 
	[@angry>|He was very calm. ]


** Macros

Define these by starting with MACRO in caps, a space, the macro label. The required replacement immediately following will be used whenever the macro is expanded. 

	[MACRO it's not][75>it's not|25>it isn't]

If you use STICKY_MACRO, the choice will be made once and then consistently for the rest of this collapse.

	[STICKY_MACRO Soda][Pepsi|Sprite|Coke]

Invoke a macro in text by wrapping it in curly braces.

	"But {it's not} relevant"


** Faking Conditional Logic **

Conditional logic is not yet supported, but you can use macros to get around this if needed. For instance.

	@wordy AND @lostKeys -> I can't find my keys!

		[@wordy>{ifLostKeys}]
		[MACRO ifLostKeys][@lostKeys>I can't find my keys!]

	@wordy AND NOT @lostKeys -> I'm wordy and organized!

		[@wordy>{ifNotLostKeys}]
		[MACRO ifNotLostKeys][@lostKeys>|I can't find my keys!]

	@wordy OR @lostKeys -> I'm wordy or confused!

		[@wordy>{txt}|{orLostKeys}]
		[MACRO orLostKeys][@lostKeys>{txt}]
		[MACRO txt][~I'm wordy or confused!]



** Formatting Codes

The system has a number of predefined formatting codes to print things in certain ways. They can either take parameters or not. These can appear within control sequences and are output verbatim. Complete list:

	{section_break}
	{chapter/2}
	{part/ONE/DOWNSTAIRS/Surely tis nobler.../William Shakespeare}
	{verse/text}
	{verse_inline/text}   => no pp breaks
	{pp}
	{i/italics}
	{vspace/9}
