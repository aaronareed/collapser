S'PART ONE\n\nDOWNSTAIRS\n\nFrom "Dark Pines Under Water," Gwendolyn MacEwen (1941-1987):\n\n"This land like a mirror turns you inward\nAnd you become a forest in a furtive lake;'
p1
aS'The dark pines of your mind reach downward,\nYou dream in the green of your time,\nYour memory is a row of sinking pines."'
p2
aS"I don't know how to tell you this. I never wanted to gut you, reach inside and pull things out, not again. Old wounds and sleeping dogs, you know. Tales better left untold. And you've heard this one, haven't you?"
p3
aS'Even if our stories, our endings, never quite agreed.'
p4
aS"But that's why I'm sitting here, writing this. If it's a story, maybe we can understand, make peace.\n\nPretend it's not ours."
p5
aS"I don't think I ever told this to you. When I was little, my dad used to come tuck me in at night, and sometimes I'd blink and he'd disappear."
p6
aS"He'd be sitting on my bed, singing or smoothing my sheets or telling a story, warm and alive, and between one blink and the next he'd be gone."
p7
aS"My heart would thump and I'd clutch the blanket, terrified, eyes thrashing back and forth across the dark spaces of my room like a trapped bird looking for a way out, looking for him, but he'd be gone, and I'd be alone."
p8
aS"Maybe premonition. More likely was that I'd fall asleep, waiting for him to come in, and dream he had. Some noise would jerk me up to a room where he'd long since looked in on me and pulled the door gently shut."
p9
aS"But how I rationalize it makes no difference. It doesn't change how I lived that loss, each night it happened. How I can feel it even today. The person who loved me most, erased from existence in a blink. I'll never forget how that felt."
p10
aS'Even if it never really happened.'
p11
aS"But this story. Our story. Maybe it's a language we can speak, you and I. Find in the telling the truths that matter. Embellish, revise. Excise. Revision."
p12
aS"Although our story was never just a story. It happened. You still remember that, don't you?"
p13
aS'Fine then. Here goes. You ready?'
p14
aS'This is what happened when we found a flight of stairs underneath my bed, and decided to climb it. Climb it all the way down.'
p15
aS"Chapter 1\n\nRight from the start things were wrong, but I couldn't see it. Maybe I didn't want to. Or maybe I'm being too hard on myself. There wasn't exactly a roadmap for what happened to us, a script to follow."
p16
aS"But it's undeniable that even on that very first night---the night of the Russian dance club, remember?---everything was already wrong."
p17
aS'I hadn\'t wanted to go to the club. But Niko insisted. "Russian techno, man, one night only. That new place over by the old stadium. Lots of sexy people will be there, including us."'
p18
aS'I ran out the usual litany of excuses: I had work in the morning, I had Bio homework to do, I hated going out to clubs with a burning passion.'
p19
aS"He batted them all away without any obvious effort, and so that's how I found myself pressed up against a wall listening to music so loud it hurt,"
p20
aS'arms crossed, feeling miserable, wishing I was back home listening to a Dvo\xc5\x99\xc3\xa1k symphony instead.'
p21
aS'When I could see him through the crowd, I watched Niko surf it, laughing, gesticulating wildly as he somehow held conversations despite the deafening racket,'
p22
aS"and dancing his ass off, mostly with girls, and once or twice with guys, whether out of politeness or genuine interest I couldn't tell."
p23
aS"I'd never really been able to tell. He flirted with everyone, flashed the same manic energy in all directions."
p24
aS"I'd worn my rainbow pride bracelet at his insistence, the one I'd bought a few months back and mostly been too chickenshit to wear (it was a college town but a conservative state)."
p25
aS"I might as well have worn a bag over my head, despite Niko's assurances that The Gays were almost definitely very into Russian techno, he was pretty sure."
p26
aS'"Or maybe all those pulsing Slavic rhythms will make some drunk straight guy want to get all experimental and shit," he said, waggling his eyebrows. "Never know."'
p27
aS'I knew. And I was right: nothing happened.'
p28
aS"No one talked to me, or even noticed me, and standing there, I couldn't imagine why they would, why anyone would want to talk to an acne-faced geek in clothes that didn't fit, leaning against a grimy wall and wishing he were anywhere else."
p29
aS'From across the club, Niko caught my eye, and gradually danced his way up to me, strobe lights washing out his tawny skin, twisting through his dark curls. He arrived within the eighteen-inch earshot zone and shouted something.\n\n"What?"'
p30
aS'He put his lips up to my ear, shouted again. "Having fun, Ryan?" He pulled back with a cheeky grin, and cackled in delight when he saw my expression, grabbing my arm. "Come on, man," he yelled, "let\'s get some air."'
p31
aS'Dragging me through the crush of people, still dancing, bopping his head to the music, waving at some people and smirking seductively at others,'
p32
aS'he somehow managed to maneuver us through an impossible blockade of bodies without stepping on any toes or getting stepped on in return,'
p33
aS"toward a back exit I hadn't even realized existed, all while making eye contact every few steps to make sure I was okay."
p34
aS"I'd never figured out how he managed to do so many things at once. Sometimes even one thing at a time was too much for me."
p35
aS"We pushed through a metal door into a blessed pillow of colder, quieter air, where a handful of smokers stood around chatting. I took a deep breath, more relieved than I'd expected to be."
p36
aS"Niko pulled a single cigarette from behind his ear---he'd quit; someone inside must have given it to him---and bummed a light from one of the smokers. We walked a few paces farther out into the parking lot, enjoying the night air."
p37
aS'"So what\'s wrong?" he finally asked.'
p38
aS'I sighed. "This isn\'t really my scene."'
p39
aS'"Leaving the house isn\'t really your scene, yeah, I get it." He blew smoke from the side of his mouth, raising one wry eyebrow. "But you have to take chances, man. Get out of your comfort zone.'
p40
aS'I mean what was the point of coming out if you never actually _go out_?"'
p41
aS'"Well it\'s fucking easier for you," I said, feeling miserable. "You can sit next to some girl in class, bump into her on the street. Say sorry for spilling her coffee, waggle your eyebrows, and boom, long term relationship."'
p42
aS'"Yeah, that\'s definitely how that works," he said. "So if it\'s that easy, Ry, how come I\'ve been single for the last forever?"'
p43
aS'"Your terrible fashion sense, probably," I said, looking down at my sneakers, although truth be told it was a mystery to me too. It had been almost a year since his last relationship. Still more recent than mine. "Okay, lame excuse.'
p44
aS'I\'m just... bad at meeting people. And I don\'t get how you\'re supposed to do it when the music\'s so loud you can\'t even think."'
p45
aS'He shrugged. "Serendipity is everywhere. So give it an excuse to happen to you. Get out there, take chances. I mean there\'s gay people everywhere, dude, even in this shithole state. You just have to man it up and figure out who they are."'
p46
aS'I looked up at him, startled, but he was looking away towards the horizon, expression distant, thinking about something. I looked back down at the ground before he could see me looking. _Stupid._\n\n"Should I take you home?" he asked at last.'
p47
aS'"You don\'t need to babysit me." My mood was blackening. "I can look after myself."'
p48
aS'"So do. No point making yourself miserable if you\'re not having fun."'
p49
aS'"I thought..." I didn\'t know how to finish. I thought he\'d wanted me to come. I thought if he were here, maybe I\'d enjoy it. I thought I could pretend to be a person who enjoyed clubs, crowds, Russian techno.'
p50
aS"I'd thought, despite all evidence, that tonight would be different."
p51
aS'"You\'re right. Guess I should jet." Hoping my voice wouldn\'t betray what was welling up inside me, I looked up, met his eyes with the best fake smile I could muster. "Catch you later, man."'
p52
aS"He looked straight back at me and I could tell he wasn't buying any of it."
p53
aS'Flicking the cigarette onto the asphalt, he ground it out with his heel, clapped my shoulder. "I\'ll come with you."'
p54
aS'"No, you don\'t have to," I said, flooded by an awkward admixture of guilt and relief. "I\'m fine. You go back in there and have some fun. Find some hot pixie chick with feathers weaved into her hair and go wild."'
p55
aS'He shot me an annoyed look, brushing black curls back from his eyes. "Orion. I said I\'m coming with you." He put an arm around my shoulder and guided me into the parking lot.'
p56
aS'"The hot chicks in there obviously have terrible taste in music, if that\'s what you could call what they were playing. I expect you might have some opinions about that."'
p57
aS'"_Well_," I said, emphatic, and laughed, surprised at myself. At him. He had a way of turning things around like that. Defeat into victory. No into yes. Everything was better again, at least for now.'
p58
aS'Talking, laughing, we struck out into the night for the long walk home.'
p59
aS"* * *\n\nWe'd been friends since freshman year of college and best friends since the year after that, and by now felt like something more, placidly absorbing jokes about being joined at the hip, going everywhere together. We did."
p60
aS"Especially since his accident, we'd had a profound if unspoken level of companionship I'd never felt with anyone. Usually I was content with that."
p61
aS"In some ways we had so little in common it was astonishing we'd become friends, and that led to frequent arguments, sometimes rising to breakup levels of drama. At other moments it seemed like the universe had meant us to find each other."
p62
aS"Over the years we'd grown together, like two plants in the same small pot."
p63
aS'It had been an especially tumultuous four years of college---although I guess it feels that way for everyone---so shared roots twined us together now,'
p64
aS'half-remembered fragments of stories and selves: skipping a funeral to camp together in the rocky canyons of Brushwillow, sharing long silences amidst the lakes and pines;'
p65
aS'pulling all-nighters on mad projects with desperate stakes;'
p66
aS'driving to the next town over through a summer midnight, windows rolled down and air thrumming through,'
p67
aS'desperate to find fresh vegetables for reasons that seemed incredibly important at the time, buzzed from both caffeine and alcohol as in so many stories involving Niko.'
p68
aS'In our defense the alcohol was supposed to go in the ragu.'
p69
aS'Walking back home from the club through the chill night air with him was a relief, and not only because the shots were starting to hit me and walking a straight line on my own would have been rough.'
p70
aS"The night felt endless, anonymous, an escape from daytime problems. In the fall we'd be starting our fifth year of college, neither of us particularly close to graduating with any particular degree, and for the first time that felt ominous."
p71
aS'The future staked out before us our whole lives was running out. A blank canvas ought to have been exciting, but any direction we could imagine to go in seemed blocked off, already closed, inaccessible or unrealistic.'
p72
aS'Friends were picking already between the remaining well-flagged routes: getting careers, getting married, getting pregnant, getting gone to new cities, new lives, new starts. It would be our turn soon enough.'
p73
aS'By the time we hit the top of the hill and saw the house, we were ready to be back indoors.'
p74
aS"We'd moved in a few weeks back, Niko and I and our friends, mostly his, students and lapsed students and a few brave graduates, still settling into the rambling old off-campus house we'd found in the newspaper."
p75
aS"(Cast your mind back to a time when kids like us had figured out the internet but people old enough to own property hadn't, so instead of browsing classifieds our bandwidth went entirely to downloading all the music in the world.)"
p76
aS"I'd gotten ranty about real music on the walk back, and as we stepped through the juddering screen door, its metal-on-wood screech already a familiar sound, I had a half-dozen songs queued up to play for him."
p77
aS"Mentally, I mean: digital music players hadn't caught on yet back then, although it was still tragically too late for my records to be anything but anachronism. Vinyl wouldn't start making a comeback for years and was deader than dead."
p78
aS'Maybe that was why I liked it.'
p79
aS"When we moved in I'd stacked my crates of LPs in the closet, so now as we tromped up the stairs to my room and dragged them out to hunt for the albums I wanted to play, we got drunkenly annoyed at the lack of anywhere to put them."
p80
aS'So that was how I ended up on my hands and knees, searching for a way to open up my bed.'
p81
aS'"Bed" was generous: it was a mattress, thrown on a raised wooden platform built into a corner of the room.'
p82
aS'The platform was mattress-sized and had therefore seemed like the sensible spot to put one, but the bulky thing also really seemed like it ought to be hollow and have some storage space inside.'
p83
aS"I'd never found any handles or hinges, but in our drink-addled haze it seemed ridiculous that the thing couldn't be opened somehow, and because I can't leave well enough alone and because unsolved challenges annoy me,"
p84
aS'and, okay, because booze, there I was on hands and knees fiddling with the paneled edges of the platform, shoving and kneading and banging on them.'
p85
aS'When something finally gave with a satisfying _chunk_, I whooped in satisfaction;'
p86
aS'but leapt back startled when the whole platform groaned and swung up, pencils and organic chemistry textbooks sliding off the mattress onto the pitted hardwood floor.'
p87
aS'Underneath was a set of steep stairs down.\n\n"Whoah," Niko said, "Jackpot."'
p88
aS'They were carpeted in the same dark beige as the rest of the house, which looked like someone had redecorated in the seventies and died decades later unaware style had moved on.'
p89
aS'Ten steps led down to a landing where they twisted right and reversed. Cramped, but bland and familiar: the walls paneled in that same fake wood as the rest of the house, lit by those same tacky wall sconces.'
p90
aS"All as you'd expect from the stairs down to a basement, except we were on the second story and the house already had a basement, which emphatically did not connect through my bed."
p91
aS'Niko laughed in astonishment. "What the fuck is this, man? What\'s down there?"'
p92
aS'"Hell if I know. More secrets." We were grinning, because this sort of thing had already happened a few times since we\'d moved in. The house had been my find.'
p93
aS'The group of us were getting older (or so we thought then) and were looking to move up in the world, so we pooled our resources to go in on a house in the pleasant tree-lined neighborhood a few blocks farther out.'
p94
aS'It was an old house, maybe as much as a hundred years old, but big, in good repair, and, most important, cheap: we were all paying less rent than when living in pairs or alone.'
p95
aS'I\'d claimed the funky second-floor patio room in a lumpy wing extending into the backyard, clearly a later addition, and Niko snagged a creaking and stuffy room next to mine which he dubbed "lovingly misshapen."'
p96
aS'A lot of the place was like that: a half-landing here, an awkward angle there, bits taken out and bricked over on some whim or other. The house had expanded and contracted over the generations, it seemed, in decades-long breaths.'
p97
aS'Niko touched the angled bottom of the bed platform and looked at me, as if for permission. He gestured grandly downwards. "Well, Orion, should we check it out?"'
p98
aS'I gave him a formal bow, the room only spinning a little. "Indeed, Nikolaos, let\'s fucking do it."'
p99
aS'He grinned and tousled my hair, bounding over the lip. He stooped as he took the first few steps, black curls brushing the underside of the tilted platform.'
p100
aS'"You going to fit down there?" I smirked. "This looks made for normal-sized people, not basketball players."'
p101
aS'"High school power-forward Nick appreciates your validation of his identity, thanks," he called back, almost to the landing. "College dilettante Niko, though, wants to know if you\'re fucking coming."'
p102
aS'I hesitated on the threshold, strangely reluctant.'
p103
aS'He turned from the landing to look back up, arms folded. "I\'m not _that_ tall, am I? I\'ve only got like three inches on you and your---" He flailed a hand up and down at me. "Your demographically average carcass. Stop giving me complexes."'
p104
aS"_Actually you're exactly four and a half inches taller than me. But who's counting._"
p105
aS'He shrugged, continued down the next set of stairs and out of sight. "Later, skater."\n\nI flipped his skinny ass off and followed him down.'
p106
aS'Despite his complaints, Niko was in fact wearing a basketball jersey, but an ironic one from the thrift store, for some hopefully-fictional team called the Reagans.'
p107
aS'He wore a purple blazer over it, which I trust is all I need say about his fashion sense. Somehow, it worked.'
p108
aS"His horrifying ensembles always worked, whereas the clothes I'd buy, new or used, turned ugly, permanently wrinkled, and the wrong size by the time I got them home."
p109
aS'"Dear LiveJournal," I\'d written once in my private, locked LiveJournal account, "I get now that I\'m destined to die alone. You can stop sending me signs."'
p110
aS'I had never shared my LiveJournal account with anyone and never would, which some people had told me was missing the point. Nowadays on social media I do a lot of typing and erasing status messages without posting them.'
p111
aS'Maybe you can relate.'
p112
aS"Anyway. Niko had shrugged his shoes off when we'd gotten to my room, and now his bare feet sunk half an inch into carpet as he tromped down the stairs, which was the detail I noticed."
p113
aS'His feet were hard not to notice: maybe it was all the basketball, or the Greek ancestry, but they were like statuary. Perfect.'
p114
aS"The stairs were steep but otherwise unextraordinary. Around the corner, more of them dropped to a second landing. We stomped down, Niko's drunken excitement leading us on like a dog straining at a leash."
p115
aS'Past that corner was one more landing and one final run of steps that opened into a large, windowless room.'
p116
aS'It was bigger than any other room in the house, maybe thirty feet across by fifty or sixty long. It had the same beige carpet and brown wall-paneling, tacky faux-bronze wall-sconces, and a plaster ceiling eight feet up.'
p117
aS'Firewood was stacked up by two fireplaces on opposite walls, in the same style as the non-functional one upstairs hidden by our TV. No windows, not even those awful basement ones that fill up with dead leaves and spider webs.'
p118
aS'No furniture, either. Just the expected bits of floor lint, carpet stains, wall gouges, and other subtle remnants of long occupation. A cool, musty smell suggested said occupation had been a long time ago.'
p119
aS'Five open doorways led out: two along each long edge, and one on the far wall opposite the stairs.'
p120
aS'"Holy shit, Ry, this is fucking amazing!" Niko\'s eyes lit up as he walked a few paces in, tentative, like into a tide. He flexed his bare toes on the ugly carpet. "It\'s like a whole secret underground lair!"'
p121
aS'I felt the same thrill, tempered with hesitation. Did our landlord somehow not know about all this extra space? Was it some kind of forgotten bomb shelter? Niko was already talking about throwing parties down here, where to put couches.'
p122
aS'A secret basement hangout spot.\n\nWe called it Downstairs, big D, without really thinking about it.'
p123
aS"The architecture was making my head spin, though. (Okay: also the beer.) But someone else's bedroom was under mine. I felt an indignant vertigo, and made Niko come resolve this mystery before exploring any farther."
p124
aS'We went back up to my room, then downstairs---regular lower-case downstairs---to reconnoiter.'
p125
aS"There was, in fact, an odd protrusion into the kitchen underneath and to one side of my room, and when we peeked into our absent housemate's bedroom around the corner, a mirroring blocky bulge in there."
p126
aS"So together those two bulges explained the stairs, though not why you'd build a staircase in the middle of a wall like that. But the house was full of those weird angles and edges, so it seemed in character."
p127
aS"We went back Downstairs and peeked into a few of the side hallways. Pretty cramped, but no worse than other god-awful basement apartments I'd seen students living in."
p128
aS'Like some of those, there were no windows anywhere, which made sense: it felt too far down. Rooms opened off the sides of the halls (those cheap particle-board doors, those rattling brass-plated tin doorknobs).'
p129
aS'Some were carpeted and looked like they could be bedrooms; others had bare concrete flooring like a laundry or utility room. They were all empty.'
p130
aS'The hallways branched at the end: we picked one and saw both ways passed more doors before making L-turns, each in opposite directions. Those crappy wall sconces were everywhere, so despite the lack of windows, it was almost too bright.'
p131
aS"They were all lit, and weirdly enough we couldn't find a light switch anywhere."
p132
aS'"You don\'t think we\'re paying for all this electricity?" Niko asked, alarmed.'
p133
aS'"We haven\'t gotten our first bill yet." I felt proud for not slurring my speech; witty. "Good thing we\'re splitting eight ways."'
p134
aS"We didn't exhaustively explore, beyond checking another hallway and seeing that it, too, branched and snaked off, shedding rooms left and right."
p135
aS'Niko had started down that one, but I stopped, a wave of nausea washing over me, and put a hand against the cold wall.'
p136
aS'He stopped instantly. "You okay?"'
p137
aS'I smiled, embarrassed. "I think, uh. Don\'t want to get too far from a bathroom."'
p138
aS'He eyed me appraisingly. "You shouldn\'t have done that last shot. I keep telling you. Beer before liquor, never sicker." He tousled my hair again, but gently. "Okay, man. Hang on just one sec.'
p139
aS'I need to see the end of this fucking hallway and then we\'ll get you back upstairs."'
p140
aS"I didn't want him to leave but couldn't think of any sane reason to stop him, so I nodded and let him go. Too many vaguely ill feelings were churning around inside me to sort them out from each other."
p141
aS'"I\'ll wait here," was all I could say, the thought of walking back up twisting stairs feeling for a queasy moment like a bad idea.'
p142
aS"He was already halfway down the hall, but lifted a hand in acknowledgment. Moments later he'd turned the corner and was gone.\n\nIt was suddenly very quiet."
p143
aS'I sunk to a sitting position, knees at my chin, back against the fake wood-paneling. _Why do you always, always drink too much? Idiot._ I tried to focus on the feel of the carpet under my butt, the smoothness of the wall at my back.'
p144
aS'I tried not to think about my stomach.\n\n_Please, please hurry back._'
p145
aS"Something changed around me, subtle but significant. Head swimming, I couldn't lock on to what, at first, was different. I blinked, squinted."
p146
aS'The light. The play of light around me had changed, gone darker, even though none of the wall sconces in my field of vision had gone out or gotten dimmer.'
p147
aS"We were at a T-junction, where the hall we'd come from, back to the big room with the five doorways, had branched in two directions."
p148
aS"I was slumped against the wall facing the way we'd come, head turned towards the right-hand fork, the way Niko had gone."
p149
aS"I decided the dimming must have come from the lights in the hall behind me, the one we hadn't explored yet. They must have gone out.\n\nCareful, still fighting nausea, I turned my head."
p150
aS'The unexplored hall was dark. The lights were off, and the dark brown walls sucked up the refracted light from the other two hallways, so that the end of this one, where it turned another corner, was right at the edge of shadow.'
p151
aS'But there was enough light to see two people standing there, holding hands.'
p152
aS"I stared and tried to unsee them, to resolve them into a trick of angles and darkness: turn off my brain's over-eager pattern matchers, finding predators in a coincidence of edges."
p153
aS"It didn't help that the hallway was spinning and I felt closer and closer to throwing up each second.\n\nThey moved."
p154
aS"Still holding hands, the shadows took a step forward, slow and deliberate. Like deer not sure if they're seeing a bobcat or a bush. I couldn't see their eyes or expression but they were facing me, looking at me."
p155
aS'And then I realized who they were.'
p156
aS'Maybe my eyes had adjusted to the dim light, or maybe my imagination was shifting into a higher gear. But like the solution to a puzzle plunking full-formed into my head I recognized, now, who was standing there at the end of the hall.'
p157
aS'Niko, and me.'
p158
aS'I clutched the carpet under my hand, feeling for the solidness of it, an anchor back to reality. Everything was spinning.'
p159
aS'My stomach churned and my mouth filled with saliva, like the glands for adrenalin and poison protection were crossing wires. Fight, flight, or puke.'
p160
aS'The faces were still dark but I recognized the way they held themselves, the silhouettes they made, the shoes. Unmistakable.'
p161
aS'I squinted into the darkness, seeing something else now. Something barely visible, even deeper in the shadows.\n\nThere were more than two of them.'
p162
aS"The second of each stood just behind the first, so I couldn't see their faces either: but they had the same silhouettes, the same heights, the same shapes. A second pair, identical. Another set."
p163
aS'They had been there all along, hidden behind the first, and I could only see them now because they were moving again, lifting up the other foot, still slow, still hesitant, following the doubles in almost perfect synchronicity.'
p164
aS'Like they were glued together.\n\nThey put the feet down, gentle, soundless on the thick carpet.'
p165
aS'Another pace closer.'
p166
aS"_Seeing double. You're drunk._ Except I'd never had it happen in three dimensions before, along the z-plane. And the edges of the hall weren't doubled at all."
p167
aS'I wondered how many more were stacked up behind them.'
p168
aS"How many more I couldn't see, each pressed up against the last, a line vanishing into the darkness, stretching back god knows how far, patient, waiting for something I could never understand.\n\nI wondered what they wanted."
p169
aS'I wondered how fast they could reach me if they started to run.'
p170
aS'"What you looking at?"'
p171
aS'Niko asked, and I _leapt_, fucking leapt to my feet like the floor was electric, whirling around to face him, body in full panic as all the building adrenalin flooded through me in an instant;'
p172
aS"panting and overwhelmed with terror and nausea and a terrible, stabbing relief at seeing him, seeing an us I could believe in instead of a pair I couldn't."
p173
aS'"The lights back there went out," I said, gasping, not looking behind me. Also, more certain: "I need to throw up."'
p174
aS'He clapped my shoulder, grim. "Let\'s get you back upstairs."'
p175
aS"I let him shepherd me away. I didn't look back down the hall."
p176
aS'But as we left, his arm protective on my shoulders, he frowned. "Didn\'t find the end of the hall, man. This place is freaking huge."'
p177
aS'Chapter 2\n\nThe hallway had twisted a few more times, Niko said, then split again. But that was all academic while I was puking my guts out over a toilet bowl, and for much of the awful day after.'
p178
aS"Still, it might seem odd that we didn't go back down there to map the whole thing out right away. I can't really explain it, unless Niko was already feeling the same irrational foreboding as me."
p179
aS"Anyway. I knew there wasn't really anything down there, Downstairs, and as the hangover faded so did the lingering terror. Replacing it was a giddy sensation like having too much Halloween candy."
p180
aS'There was a whole huge secret basement under our house that only we knew about. It felt good to have another secret. Another code in our personal dictionary, something only for us.'
p181
aS'Niko was terrible at secrets. By next afternoon, all the other housemates had seen Downstairs too, as well as a couple of his basketball buddies and one or two of his closest philosophy buddies.'
p182
aS"(He'd made a point of changing majors and hobbies once a quarter for the past year, while continuing to swear up and down to his immigrant parents he was still majoring in Economics.) I tried not to take the betrayal personally."
p183
aS'But the strange thing was that no one seemed much interested. Everyone agreed Downstairs was a cool find, and made for a nice hangout spot, but no one cared to venture too far outside the big central room, or spend too much time down there.'
p184
aS"Everyone other than Niko and I would get bored, start talking about other things, eventually drift back upstairs to whatever they'd been doing before.\n\nOdd, in hindsight."
p185
aS'We did end up moving a couple couches down (and it was murder getting them around those tight landings, let me tell you) and a half-dozen boxes of my records,'
p186
aS'and made the Big Room available as a kind of secondary hangout space, quieter than the crowded front room with the TV and people always coming and going.'
p187
aS"Some of the empty rooms off the big one turned into overflow storage for everyone's miscellaneous shit, but remained otherwise unoccupied."
p188
aS'"Man, y\'all could live rent-free," one of Niko\'s ex-bandmates said one night while we were down there, poking her head into another lonely room. "Let these out to those poor engineering frosh. They don\'t see no daylight anyway."'
p189
aS'"Yeah," I said, "except everyone would have to come in and out through my bed."'
p190
aS'"I mean they wouldn\'t walk directly over you," she explained, patting a patronizing hand on my shoulder. "Even though I know that kind of sad sack white boy victim scene is right up your alley.'
p191
aS'You ask nice, they\'ll just gently kick you out of the way."'
p192
aS"I liked most of Niko's friends, but I don't think the feeling was mutual. I'm sure they all wondered what he saw in me."
p193
aS'No one did end up moving down there. Zero natural light is kind of a downer, even for well-adjusted people. Niko made some noise about bringing a girl down sometime. ("Dude, it\'s a secret make-out lair.'
p194
aS'You\'re doing college wrong if you don\'t get some action down there.") But we both knew he wouldn\'t actually do it.'
p195
aS'It was too quiet, for one thing.'
p196
aS"It also felt forbidden, somehow, but not in like a sexy rule-breaking kind of way. Being down there had the vague flavor of trespassing, the kind where you're not going to get away with it and it'll go bad for you when you get caught."
p197
aS"Sneaking into a restricted area at the airport; busting into Area 51. I mean it was our house, right? But Downstairs didn't feel like ours."
p198
aS"Enough laughter or booze or noise and the feeling went away, or at least buried itself somewhere deep, where you'd hardly ever notice it."
p199
aS'Maybe because of that, definitely because of day-to-day distractions, maybe also because we enjoyed prolonging the sense of mystery,'
p200
aS'and, okay, because I was sulking, more than a week passed before we got around to scoping out the place in depth.'
p201
aS"Niko spent a day in an extraordinary funk of fierce depression followed by an equally intense reversal, like he'd do from time to time, and I took advantage of his high to prod him into going to scope out Downstairs."
p202
aS'He took to this plan eagerly, and seemed pleased when I told him I\'d been waiting so we could do it together. "Ryan," he said fondly, "in an emergency, you know, you can do things without me. I\'ll allow it."'
p203
aS'"Well, I kind of thought this was like, our thing, you know."'
p204
aS'He fell onto one knee. "Oh, my noble Orion," he intoned, "canst thou e\'er forgive such rank betrayal, breaking this our vow of secrecy? Will thy gentle heart recover---"\n\n"Okay, okay," I said, waving my hand. "Get over yourself."'
p205
aS"He leapt up with a wicked grin, made himself a pot of coffee, put on a truly awful and unseasonable Christmas sweater, and headed Downstairs with me to map out what was down there.\n\nExcept we couldn't."
p206
aS"We'd grabbed flashlights in case of dark corners or burnt-out bulbs, but didn't need them. Every hall was lit by those cheerful bright wall sconces, and most of the side rooms had a single bare bulb in the center of the ceiling."
p207
aS"But it was the damnedest thing. We couldn't find an end to the place. We picked one hallway and wandered around for maybe fifteen minutes, through T-junctions and ninety-degree corners, past dozens of doors and empty rooms."
p208
aS'The same wood-paneled walls, seventies carpet, and wall sconces were everywhere. Downstairs was aggressively bland but disturbingly unbounded. It went from weird to surreal to sort of frightening, how much of it there was.'
p209
aS'And this was just one of the five hallways off the central room.'
p210
aS"I'd poked my head into a room with a nook at the far end, a wooden dowel running along the top---like a doorless closet, maybe."
p211
aS'I wandered over to investigate, hoping for a few dusty hangers, the remnants of an old calendar, some comforting sign of former human occupation. No such luck.'
p212
aS'I mean, the place looked like people should have lived there, but there was almost nothing around to prove it.'
p213
aS'Anonymous marks scuffed the walls, the odd piece of lint dotted the floor, but there were no height marks penciled on door frames, no piles of old magazines, no bright squares on dirty walls where pictures once hung.'
p214
aS'Not a single old candy wrapper or forgotten sock. I ran my hand across the wooden dowel and wondered who had put it there, if anyone had ever hung clothes from it.'
p215
aS"I turned around and saw Niko hadn't followed me in. I felt a moment of disorientation. The door seemed a long way away."
p216
aS"No---blinking, I realized it wasn't that. When I'd turned back toward the doorway, it wasn't there."
p217
aS"I frowned. The doorway was on the other side of the room from the one I'd instinctively turned to. I thought I'd walked along the wall to get to the nook, that it and the door had been on the same side."
p218
aS'But the door was on the opposite wall, diagonally across from me.'
p219
aS"I closed my eyes, suddenly dizzy. I remembered keeping the faded white wall to my right as I crossed the carpet to the closet nook. But when I looked again, the door was still where it was, in the opposite corner. Obviously it hadn't moved."
p220
aS"_You're doing it again._"
p221
aS"_Don't see things that aren't there. You fucking idiot._"
p222
aS"Pushing away the uneasiness, I crossed diagonally across the carpet to the door, unable as I did to shake the sensation that I was tracing a different path than the one I'd walked coming in.\n\nThat this door led somewhere else."
p223
aS'I pushed my head out into the hallway. It looked just the same. Of course, they all did.\n\n"Niko?"'
p224
aS'No answer.'
p225
aS"_Cool_, I thought, keeping a firm grip on myself. I walked down the hall in the direction we'd been headed, peeked around the corner."
p226
aS'More hall, more carpet, more doors. No Niko.\n\nI shouted his name again, louder.'
p227
aS'Nothing.\n\nIt was so quiet.'
p228
aS"I started down the hall, then halfway down thought maybe I should go back, not forward; then stopped in confusion. If you're lost you're supposed to stay put, not wander around.\n\n_I've never been lost in a basement before._"
p229
aS'The knob on the nearest door started to turn.'
p230
aS"My heart tried to jump out my throat. The door thumped. The knob turned the other way, faster, more violent.\n\nWith a shuddery squeal the door burst open, Niko's shoulder leading the rest of him out."
p231
aS'"Stuck," he said, jiggling the knob. "Like the one upstairs. Oh, goddammit. I spilled my coffee."'
p232
aS'We looked down at the new dark stain on the carpet. He licked droplets from his fingers, inspected a candy-caned sweater cuff. "Thank Christ it didn\'t stain the cashmere."'
p233
aS'"That is _not_ cashmere," I said, rolling my eyes. "Hey. Don\'t wander off on me like that."'
p234
aS"I didn't want to admit how spooked I'd been, and thought I'd done a good job hiding it, but of course he knew me better than that."
p235
aS'He stared into me and seeing those emerald eyes full of concern was enough to melt my fear, transmute it into something infinitely better.'
p236
aS'"Okay," I laughed. "You\'re not in trouble. Just stay close, yeah?"'
p237
aS'"Sure, and sorry, but hey." His eyes had a mischievous glint. "Come check it out. I found\n\nstairs."'
p238
aS'* * *\n\nThe new stairs led down into darkness. From the top we could see about twenty or thirty steps before things got shadowy, and enough of the shadows to tell the stairs kept descending for a while after that.'
p239
aS'Niko had been excited to show me, but now he perched uneasily on the top step. I got out my flashlight and switched it on, pointing down. "Come on. Maybe there\'s some answers down there." He still looked hesitant.'
p240
aS'I put on my straightest face and my best P.I. voice. "Don\'t you want to get... to the bottom of this?"'
p241
aS'"Mmm." He frowned in concern. "I just wouldn\'t want your boyfriend to get jealous, me spending all this time down here with you."'
p242
aS"This was a little joke of his. I didn't have a boyfriend."
p243
aS'But he flicked on his own light, waved me on. "After you, amigo."'
p244
aS'There were maybe eighty steps. Other than that, and the fact that we were lighting our way with flashlights, they seemed like any other stairs in a house built during the Carter administration and sinking into senility.'
p245
aS'That same damn carpet. They must have bought up the whole factory.'
p246
aS'The wall sconces were still there, but no longer lit. Still no light switches anywhere.'
p247
aS'When the stairs finally gave out, it was into another hallway, nearly identical to the ones above.'
p248
aS'This one felt a bit smaller, and the carpet a darker shade, looking more brown now, though maybe both impressions were a trick of the flashlights.'
p249
aS"More rooms opened off this hall, though these had more variety. A few doors were locked, which we hadn't encountered on the upper level. Some of the rooms seemed like bedrooms: a few even had old bed frames and mattresses in them."
p250
aS"I searched the walls in vain for colored tacks with ripped corners of posters still attached, or even a crumpled gas station receipt. It wasn't like the place was sterile."
p251
aS'Another room had a drain in the floor with stains running up to two big utility hookups on the wall, and the faint smells of dust and moths and yellowing wallpaper glue were everywhere. What was missing was anything personal.'
p252
aS'The weirdest room, though, was the kitchen.'
p253
aS'It was too big for a kitchen, for starters, and had too much stuff in it: too many oven hookups, too much haphazard ceiling ventilation,'
p254
aS'red-handled water valves everywhere, and a dozen jumbled stove tops with holes where the burners should be.'
p255
aS'There were parts of appliances but no whole ones: bundles of wiring, even a kitchen sink. Niko tried the faucet and we both were startled when water came out.'
p256
aS'It was like a half-assembled restaurant kitchen with all the equipment jumbled together, rather than a row of stoves here, a row of dishwashers there.'
p257
aS'I found what was clearly the plumbing for a toilet hookup in the middle of one wall, and had to put my foot down about this making any sense at all.'
p258
aS'"Maybe a wall was supposed to go up here?" Niko shined his light between the bathroom plumbing and the nearest stovetop, but the kitchen stuff extended to either side.'
p259
aS'"Who puts a toilet in the middle of a kitchen?" I didn\'t get it.\n\nHe shrugged.'
p260
aS'Just the one door, too, and nothing nearby that might have been a dining room or pantry. A few doors down was a long, narrow room paved entirely in yellow bathroom tile and graying grout.'
p261
aS'A rust-pitted shower head, two immobile handles, and dirt-clogged drain clustered at one end, thirty feet away from the opposite wall.'
p262
aS'"You get the feeling whoever built this place didn\'t exactly know a lot about architecture?" Niko\'s voice was hushed in a kind of reverence. "Everything down here\'s off, you know?'
p263
aS'Like, who was that old lady in California who built that house with all the doors that went nowhere and fake hallways and everything?"'
p264
aS"Sarah Winchester. I told him. Except her house is now an internationally famous tourist attraction. And this place was bigger.\n\nWhy didn't anyone _know_ about this?"
p265
aS'Niko was thinking along the same lines. "Seriously, though. Who the fuck built all this? And why? For what?"'
p266
aS'"No clue. But if there\'s any explanation, it\'s probably down here somewhere." I even half-believed that, which felt nice.'
p267
aS'"I feel weird walking around a crazy person\'s house." His eyes darted around the empty room. "Not that I expect, like, pit traps and rotating blades. But it feels sort of... unsafe."'
p268
aS'He had finished his coffee and was fiddling nervously with the mug, twirling it by the handle back and forth in his fingers.'
p269
aS'He kept glancing at me like he wanted me to say something that would make him feel better, to save him, so I tried my best like always. "You ever notice old horror movies have lots of really improbable architecture?" I babbled.'
p270
aS'"I want to meet some of those architects. Probably all dead now but I still want to grab them by their ghostly lapels and ask why the fuck they built all those crawlspaces and secret torture rooms and basements without proper lighting."'
p271
aS'"Can we not talk about horror movies right now? Also, ghosts. Maybe just shut up, actually." But he was grinning.\n\nWe moved on.'
p272
aS'The next door we tried was another locked one. For some reason, I knocked.'
p273
aS'"Why did you do that?" Niko hissed. I shrugged, smiling despite myself. But then a weird sensation came over me, like walking on someone\'s grave. Because as silly as it was, we both couldn\'t help waiting for a breath or two.\n\nListening.'
p274
aS"Isn't that how that expression goes, walking on someone's grave? Or is it someone walking on yours? No, that wouldn't make sense. Never mind.\n\nThere was no answer, of course."
p275
aS'"You\'re freaking me out, man," Niko said. He held the light under his face, washing it out to a ghostly tan as his eyes rolled up into his head. "Vreeaking meee owwwwt."\n\n"Attractive."'
p276
aS'"You would totally date undead me. Rotting flesh and all. Don\'t pretend you wouldn\'t."'
p277
aS'"You\'re half-skeleton already. There\'s barely any flesh to rot off you."'
p278
aS'"Come on." He grabbed my shoulder and propelled me down the hall. "Let\'s keep going." The rough of his hand shocked some courage back into me. My shoulder felt cool when he took the hand away.'
p279
aS"A few more paces down the hallway, it opened into a six-sided room, a closed door in each wall other than the one we'd entered through. We tried a few. Each door opened onto another staircase leading down."
p280
aS'"But _seriously_," Niko said, alarmed. "This cannot possibly be here. It doesn\'t make sense." He looked towards me, desperate. "Ryan, help."'
p281
aS'"Okay," I said, grasping at straws. "Maybe it\'s like a whole underground network. All the houses in the neighborhood connected together. People used to smuggle drugs or something. Underground railroad."'
p282
aS'"Decor\'s too new," he countered. "And we haven\'t found any other stairs back up."'
p283
aS'"Bomb shelter. Last owner decided to modernize. Dreamt of turning it into the ultimate student housing complex.'
p284
aS'Collapsed from construction debt before he could get rich off desperate kids willing to live in windowless asbestos-lined death traps."'
p285
aS'He shook his head. "Let\'s go back, man. I don\'t like this. Something\'s not right."'
p286
aS'"It can\'t go on forever," I said. "And whatever\'s deepest down will be most interesting, right?"'
p287
aS"I talked him into it. It didn't take that much doing. He felt the same pull as me. And there was nothing dangerous down here: it wasn't like exploring an abandoned mine shaft."
p288
aS'Everything was in perfect repair even if no one seemed to have been here for years.\n\nBig as it was, it was only architecture.'
p289
aS"The staircase we picked dropped down for a few dozen steps, then turned at a weird angle and dropped some more. It wasn't necessarily smaller but felt more claustrophobic."
p290
aS'Maybe that was my brain reminding me how deep underground we must be getting. At most of the landings a new hall branched off, each at a different angle. We kept going down.'
p291
aS'After four or five weird angled twists the stairs ended, opening up into another corridor. Everything felt exactly the same, despite being stories deeper underground. It was as bland and anonymous as office space in a skyscraper.'
p292
aS'There were more doors.'
p293
aS"We shuffled past them, flashlights glinting off doorknobs and---_there_ was a difference---instead of the wall sconces, fake candelabra now. You know the ones, with those awful faux-candles that flicker orange and don't fool anyone?"
p294
aS"They weren't lit now, anyway."
p295
aS"It's hard to explain the quiet. It felt complete in a deeper way than absence of sound. Like we were far away from anything that made noise, other than us. I guess we were."
p296
aS'We stopped less to try side doors now, eager to get to the end of the hall, or the end of something, at least. Find some answers.'
p297
aS"For a long stretch there were no doors at all, just wood paneling, so that when we did come to another door it was a relief, like exhaling held breath. Niko tried it, and it swung open onto a room like nothing we'd seen so far."
p298
aS'It was concrete and tall, with rounded corners at the bottom. The ceiling was higher than the walls, like we were in a pit dug into a bigger room. In the center of the concrete floor was a drain.'
p299
aS'Niko, intrigued, grabbed the bottom of a short ladder that ended around shoulder-height and pulled himself up to the top of the pit, flashlight swinging wildly. I clung to mine, keeping it steady like a candle I was afraid would blow out.'
p300
aS'I felt afraid, without quite knowing why.'
p301
aS'He shined his light back down at me. "Yep," he said, "it\'s a swimming pool."'
p302
aS'That made sense, by some incredibly loose definition. "What\'s up there?"'
p303
aS'He turned away from the lip, moved out of sight. Patterns of light swam across the ceiling as he swung the flashlight around. Something rattled. "Another kitchen." His voice bounced oddly off the rounded concrete.'
p304
aS'"This one\'s all furnished, though."'
p305
aS'I was getting more and more unsettled, unaccountably so. "Any more doors?"'
p306
aS'The reflections of light moved to and fro, like something alive. "Nope. No way in or out except through the pool. And there\'s no place to sit and eat, either." He paused. More scuffling. "Funny. The fridge is locked.'
p307
aS'Like, there\'s a keyhole on the fridge and you can\'t open it. Who does that?"'
p308
aS"The door we'd come through, I noticed, was the same as all the others: cheap particle board, regular brass-plated knob. Not especially waterproof. I bent down, pushed it shut."
p309
aS"Sure enough, there was a gap between it and the top of the carpet. Like you'd expect for any regular door not, you know, at the bottom of a swimming pool."
p310
aS'"Hey, Niko?" I straightened up, keeping my voice steady. "Let\'s go back."'
p311
aS"I wanted to add _I don't like this_ or maybe _I want to get the hell out of here right now_, but some irrational fear gripped me that if I showed any weakness, he'd be the one who wanted to keep going down.\n\nGoing deeper."
p312
aS'Something rattled up there, wood scraping wood. "There\'s silverware in these drawers," he called, as if he hadn\'t heard me. "Cups in the cabinets too. Super seventies. Like the cups your grandma probably has, you know?"'
p313
aS'His voice was starting to seem unreal. I felt how tenuous a connection I had to him: a voice, the glints of his flashlight on the ceiling above the empty pool. Echoes and shadows.'
p314
aS'The distance between us seemed vast and growing vaster, maybe already unbridgeable.\n\nI remembered lying in bed as a kid, waiting to be tucked in, and the person I loved most in the world vanishing, between one blink and the next.'
p315
aS"And then. Maybe I imagined this, between the weird echoes of that concrete pool bottom and the nerves I'd worked up. But I thought I heard muffled voices. Faint. Coming through the wall."
p316
aS'Coming from the other side of the closed door back.'
p317
aS'Chapter 3\n\nI stumbled back from the door, heart pounding. "Niko," I hissed, trying to inject all the urgency I felt into the shape of his name, "get back down here, right now!"'
p318
aS'He must have heard something in my voice, because seconds later his head poked over the edge, and he slid down the ladder and dropped the last few feet onto concrete.'
p319
aS'I could see him, I could suddenly even smell him, and that tangible reality felt overwhelmingly reassuring. I grabbed his arm and even his awful not-cashmere sweater was comforting.\n\n"What\'s up?"'
p320
aS'"I thought..." The noise had gone; I felt foolish. "I heard someone out there."'
p321
aS'He walked to the door, pulling away from me. "No don\'t!" I hissed, but his hand was already on the knob, he was already turning it, pushing the door open, stepping out into the hallway. Shining his light left, back the way we\'d come.'
p322
aS'He turned, to shine it to the right.'
p323
aS'And for an instant I was sure\n\n something\n\naround the corner was going to grab him and in the same instant with nightmarelogic certainty I knew it was my fault for imagining it\n\n for making it real\n\nbut nothing happened. He shrugged.'
p324
aS'"I don\'t hear anything, man."\n\nNeither did I.'
p325
aS'"Let\'s get back anyway," he said. "I\'m not even sure how long we\'ve been down here. Your boyfriend\'s going to kill me."'
p326
aS"As we walked back up the hall through the zone without doors, I glanced behind me. I noticed with a frown we'd left the door to the pool room open."
p327
aS'It felt wrong, somehow. A bad omen.'
p328
aS'But no way in hell was I walking back to shut it.'
p329
aS"* * *\n\nWe lay on my closed-again bed and stared up at the ceiling, giggling. We couldn't help ourselves. It felt good to be out of there, to have the whole ridiculous mystery literally at our backs."
p330
aS'Even an old mattress felt like shield enough.'
p331
aS"I'd felt better with each upward step."
p332
aS'The earlier rooms were familiar as we hit them in reverse: the six-sided room with its stairs down (which Niko kept insisting, incorrectly, was called a sexagon), the bright yellow light of the upper halls,'
p333
aS'Niko\'s coffee stain ("so typical," I told him, "you\'ve marked this place with your distinctive musk") and the big empty room with its couches and piles of everyone\'s junk.'
p334
aS"By the time we'd climbed the final stairs to my room and swung the bed shut, we were giddy, flushed with excitement, brimming with explanations and theories."
p335
aS'"It must run under the whole neighborhood," Niko was saying. "Connect to other houses, or maybe it only used to. Maybe no one knows about it any more." He grinned. "Except us."'
p336
aS'"It doesn\'t make sense," I was still protesting, but it felt more silly than sinister. I shook my head, embarrassed by my freak-out earlier. I was spooking myself for no reason.'
p337
aS"If someone else was down there, wouldn't they have come to say hi?\n\n_Maybe they did._"
p338
aS'I shook my head again. It was cool, and nothing was going to get in the way of that.'
p339
aS'Niko jumped off the bed up to his feet, then swayed and put out a hand to touch the wall. I frowned, sitting up. "Okay?" Sometimes he blacked out if he stood up too fast. I worried.'
p340
aS'"Yeah, yeah," he said, waving a hand. "Just need some more coffee. Or booze. Maybe both."'
p341
aS"I did some legit research in the next few days. Our landlord stopped by to see how we were settling in and reassure us he'd fix the things he said he'd fix before we moved in, which he clearly wasn't going to fix."
p342
aS'He was a younger guy with kind of a stoner vibe, on the whole not very plausible as a landlord.'
p343
aS"When I casually asked how he'd come to acquire a hundred-year-old house in a rather nice college town, he said he was trying to make a living off rental properties and we were the first students to move into this one."
p344
aS'He mentioned he\'d gotten a good deal on the house because of the maintenance it needed (embarrassed cough) and because the city sold it at auction and they "weren\'t allowed to play bidding games and shit" with it.'
p345
aS'"So the city repossessed it or something? Do you know who owned it before?" I asked, practically exuding casual nonchalance.'
p346
aS'"Been empty for a long time," he said. "Was filled up with a ton of junk. Had to cart it all away before listing it."'
p347
aS'"Oh yeah? What kind of junk?"'
p348
aS'"Just..." he twirled his hand in a vague circle. "Stuff. Old furniture, old paint, piles of bricks. Nothing valuable."'
p349
aS"I didn't ask if he knew anything about a secret basement the size of a city block, because I was afraid our rent would go up."
p350
aS"Down at city hall I looked up the property history, which I'd hoped would be more interesting than the chemistry I should have been studying. The house had indeed been built about a hundred years earlier."
p351
aS'The records were aggressively boring. Certainly nothing about enormous sub-basements or a fleet of mining vehicles. I even hunted through microfilm of the local paper for anything unusual the week of construction. No dice.'
p352
aS'After that, the trail went a bit cold because I had another acne flare-up, a bad one, dropped out of a class instead of showing up to take the midterm and felt generally miserable about myself for a couple of days.'
p353
aS"I finally pulled myself together enough to get some groceries and refill the expired prescription on my acne cream. I was in the bathroom, rubbing it on my pockmarked face and thinking about how much I'd been lied to as a kid."
p354
aS"_Oh, that'll clear up when you get older._ Also _You'll figure girls out eventually_ and _There's someone out there for everyone_. Classics, all."
p355
aS'Niko popped his head around the corner. "Dude. Phone\'s for you." He blinked at me. "You realize when you do that, it looks like you\'re rubbing jizz all over your face."'
p356
aS"I didn't really see it. The last thing I thought about when looking in the mirror was anything sexy."
p357
aS'He must have guessed what I\'d been thinking, because he punched my shoulder. "Dude, get over yourself. You\'re not Quasimodo." He sighed. "We need to get you a boyfriend."'
p358
aS'"Store was fresh out," I said, but grimly resolved to start wearing my pride bracelet out in public again. "Who\'s on the phone?"'
p359
aS'"Some lady from the local history society? I thought she had the wrong number, but she asked for you by name."'
p360
aS"I had in fact called the history society a few days earlier, and the voice on the phone belonged to an elderly woman who breathlessly said she'd love to chat about the old houses in our neighborhood,"
p361
aS'and invited us over to the society office for a cup of tea.'
p362
aS'The office turned out to be her living room. We sat on a sun-faded couch sipping something tasteless while she fawned over us ("so _wonderful_ to see young people take an interest in local history"). It was awkward.'
p363
aS'I asked if she knew anything interesting about our address or any people who used to live there.'
p364
aS"She wasn't familiar with the house, although the mayor had once lived on our street, she told us, and she thought most of the houses near there had been built around the same time."
p365
aS'Flailing, I asked if she knew anything about tunnels or underground rooms around town.'
p366
aS"She spun a not-very-interesting story about how during Prohibition a local bootlegger had dug a tunnel that led from his basement all the way to a poplar in the neighbor's backyard---nearly fifty feet long."
p367
aS'I smiled and nodded until I found a way to excuse us.'
p368
aS'Meanwhile Niko had been making excursions on his own.'
p369
aS"I got kind of upset when he told me---I'd wanted it to be our thing, something we did together---but he said he'd come get me the instant he found anything interesting, and didn't make too big deal out of it. It really bothered me, though."
p370
aS'I thought about going on my own too but it felt wrong without him there. I itched with overwhelming curiosity but also a certain dread that kicked my heartbeat up a notch when I thought about walking too far down those halls, those stairs.'
p371
aS"I told myself I was being stupid but my pulse didn't listen."
p372
aS'Niko spitballed the idea of making a map, but figured it would be tricky. "A lot of those angles are non-standard," he said. "Those funny twists on the stairs down from the sexagon, right?'
p373
aS'They\'re more than ninety degrees but less than the next sensible unit---one thirty-five or whatever. I have a feeling if you measured them they\'d be fractional. Like one twenty nine point two three eight three eight." He laughed.'
p374
aS'"Three eight three eight three eight three eight three---"\n\n"Quit it. Also, Romeo, it\'s \'hexagon.\'"\n\nHe smirked. "Irrational."'
p375
aS'Some of the halls sloped up or down, too, enough that you could feel it when you walked them. Keeping track of what level everything was on would add to the confusion. I dragged discussion back up to the bigger picture.'
p376
aS'"It has to be mostly running east, doesn\'t it? Because of the hill. That big stairway doesn\'t go down far enough to get under 12th Street."'
p377
aS'"I don\'t know." He visualized with closed eyes for a moment, then shrugged and opened them, shaking his head. "Hard to keep a sense of direction down there. We\'ll bring a compass next trip.'
p378
aS'You think those new GPS things for hiking would work?"'
p379
aS'"No, they need line of sight to the sky. We could leave breadcrumbs, like Hansel and Gretel."'
p380
aS'"We might have to, if it\'s much bigger." His eyes widened. "Can you imagine getting lost? Like some estate agent\'s nightmare. \'My god, I\'ll never be able to replace all this carpet!\'"\n\nWe had a party down there.'
p381
aS"By unspoken agreement, the housemates didn't advertise the extent of the place: I put police caution tape from the dollar store across all the doorways out of the big room, as a joke, though I suspected I wasn't really joking."
p382
aS'It was fine if everyone just saw a chill basement hangout spot. Much levity was made from the fact that you had to climb in and out of my bed to get there, or to go back up and take a piss.'
p383
aS'We brought down a foosball table, some Christmas lights, lots of booze, and the stereo. I protested that my record collection was for archival purposes, not playing at parties, but I was overruled.'
p384
aS'It was an okay turnout and everyone, for all the usual reasons, focused on getting good and drunk. My usual social ineptness kept me from truly enjoying myself.'
p385
aS'Some girl tried to hit on me;'
p386
aS'I was so startled by this I blurted "Actually, I\'m gay," which was even more awkward out loud than it sounds written down,'
p387
aS'and she laughed noisily and commiserated about the tragic ironies of dating for a few embarrassing seconds before vanishing,'
p388
aS'and only too late did I think to ask what the hell had compelled her to talk to me in the first place, because certainly whatever it was had never worked on any guys.'
p389
aS"Not that I'd figured out how to go to parties where guys who'd be interested would hang out, anyway."
p390
aS"I hated dance clubs and the couple gay bars I'd stepped into had given me massive anxiety attacks;"
p391
aS'I still felt a rush of panic when I thought about walking through the door of the tiny LGBT center on campus, even after years of passing it on the way to classes.'
p392
aS"I'd always thought things would get easier in college. At my enormous high school there hadn't been a single out queer person, and I sure as hell wasn't going to be the first."
p393
aS'Not only because of crippling shyness, self-image issues, and fear for my actual life, but because I literally did not know how to come out.'
p394
aS"Ellen hadn't done it on national TV yet when I was in high school; Kevin Kline hadn't done it at the movies, let alone sultry-eyed Jake Gyllenhaal;"
p395
aS'not enough gay teens had been famously killed or killed themselves to inspire anyone to tell us It Gets Better.'
p396
aS'Gay people basically did not exist in my universe, and yet there was I, somehow, gay regardless. College was supposed to have been an improvement. But once I got there, I failed to blossom into a beautiful flower.'
p397
aS"Maybe I should have moved farther away, to an actual big city, rather than somewhere close by and familiar and still red-state as fuck: but the problem wasn't my environment, I came to realize, it was me."
p398
aS"It wasn't that I had issues with being gay: the internet had given me plenty of opportunities to come to terms and feel okay about it. I just didn't know how to be it in public, with other people, on any level but especially a romantic one."
p399
aS"I'd never dated or even asked anyone out, and more and more it felt too late to start."
p400
aS'Meanwhile the straight people were having a nice party.'
p401
aS'Niko, wearing a blue bowling shirt with "My Name is BONG" stitched into the lapel and a pair of tight-fitting lime-green jeans, was shadowing some girl he\'d been trying to hit it off with. It wasn\'t going well.'
p402
aS'They got into an argument early in the evening (Dear LiveJournal: I tune out when I hear the phrase "That\'s _not_ what Marx said") and she stormed off up the stairs.'
p403
aS'Niko fumed, then stormed off himself, reappearing minutes later in a Linkin Park t-shirt and torn jeans and carrying a bottle of tequila, which he used like a police baton to corral me into a corner to do shots with him.'
p404
aS'"Said I dress too fucking weird for her," he said with a hollow Ashes to Ashes sort of intonation. "Is _this_ fucking normal enough? Whatever. The hell with everyone." I could drink to that.'
p405
aS'We threw back a shot, sitting on the carpet with our backs to the paneled wall. Niko was always swinging between extremes: at high ebbs he wanted to be friends with everyone, at low ebbs I was the only person in the universe.'
p406
aS"He was busy furiously ignoring the rest of the party, which I wasn't feeling much connection to either."
p407
aS'He sniffed. "You know when we first moved over here I didn\'t speak any English?" I nodded; I\'d heard this story before. "My parents thought it\'d be cute to dump me into third grade like that. You know, _full immersion_." His face twisted.'
p408
aS"I poured him another shot, thinking I probably shouldn't, but by then I already had."
p409
aS'He leaned back against the wall, looking worn down. "I tried so fucking hard to fit in. To get to where just opening my mouth didn\'t mark me out as a freak. By the time junior high started none of the new kids even knew.'
p410
aS'Master fucking performance." He tugged at the t-shirt, a corner of his mouth twitching. "Meanwhile the fam all expects things to be exactly like we\'d never left.'
p411
aS"Like America's just a little rest stop, like of course I'll want to go back to Greece and have a million kids as soon as I graduate. My aunt asked me at Thanksgiving why I wasn't married yet."
p412
aS'I reminded her I am twenty-two years old and still in the middle of fucking college. She said neither of those things stopped my uncle."'
p413
aS'I was staring idly at a dark-haired girl and a bearded jock flirting on the couch across the room, words swallowed up by the thumping of the stereo. Thinking about the music echoing down all those empty halls.'
p414
aS'"I can\'t even imagine getting married."\n\n"Yeah, neither can the government."'
p415
aS'"Not just that, asshole." I side-kicked him, then frowned, trying to figure out what I wanted to say, how deep I wanted to go. Fuck it. I let the tequila talk. "I don\'t know.'
p416
aS'I can\'t imagine anyone wanting to spend the rest of their life with me. Or that I could believe someone would say yes, if I wanted to with them."'
p417
aS'I closed my mouth, feeling stupid, but he was nodding. "Yeah, I dig you. Thinking you could be that for someone. Believing in yourself that much." He was frowning. "I can\'t believe in anything they fucking want me to be."'
p418
aS'He tilted his head back, eyes closed. "Well, you ever make it there, you got a best man lined up at least." He opened one skeptical eye. "Or are there two best men? How would all that even work?"'
p419
aS'"I don\'t know." I closed my eyes, too. _Dear LiveJournal. Figure out how all that even works._'
p420
aS'We listened to the music for a minute, surrounded by people who naturally knew how to Saturday night, without training. It was kind of nice being near them, at least.\n\nNiko said, very quiet: "You think there\'s something wrong with me?"'
p421
aS'I opened my eyes, looked at him. His were still closed. The flashing Christmas lights were lost in his black curls, more swallowed up than reflected by them.'
p422
aS'A corner of his mouth lifted. "Stupid question."\n\n"You\'ll make it," I said, more because I wanted him to believe it than because I\'d given it any real thought.'
p423
aS"I'd rarely seen his face at rest like this, without its usual mask of social engagement---he liked to play gracious host,"
p424
aS'loudmouthed philosopher---and the strong curves of his prominent jaw, his sharp nose, seemed fragile in the shifting light.'
p425
aS'Sharp, but delicate. Able to be shattered.'
p426
aS'"Not fucking likely." His brow furrowed, but then his face relaxed. He downed the rest of the shot, clinked his empty glass against mine, and leaned into me, just a little. "Nice to have someone around to humor me, though.'
p427
aS'Keep doing that, yeah?"\n\n"No problemo," I said, leaning into him, too.'
p428
aS'We stayed like that for a few minutes.'
p429
aS'Then some friends of his tromped down the stairs and he leapt up, pulling a sparkling smile and manic laugh out from somewhere, pouring drinks and giving high fives,'
p430
aS'and dragged me with him into the noise, and one of his friends talked me into getting trounced at foosball, and everyone kept drinking.'
p431
aS'And the moment between us faded into ephemera and lost any possible significance, even to me.'
p432
aS"Not long after, Niko disappeared. I figured maybe he'd gone back to his room to be alone: despite appearances, his social energy was limited, had to be rationed."
p433
aS"I didn't think anything of it, focused on getting drunk with everyone else because it seemed like the thing to do.\n\nMidnight passed, unnoticed."
p434
aS'Some time later the party started winding down. Soon it had winnowed to a couple hardcore foosballers, the girl and the beardy dude making out on the couch, and a few sozzled, earnest conversations in corners.'
p435
aS"I extracted myself from one of these, but on my way upstairs to take a leak I noticed that the flashlight we'd left by the hall---the one that led to the sexagon---hexagon---whatever---and the long stairs, and the pool---was gone."
p436
aS"Had he gone exploring? Tonight?\n\nIf he had, he'd been gone a long time."
p437
aS"An hour later the party had just about wrapped. Still no sign of Niko. I'd checked his bedroom---empty---and polled a few housemates. No one had seen him since the start of the night."
p438
aS'I felt a stab of guilt for getting so wasted, for not looking out for him; pushed down vague resentments at feeling like I had to.'
p439
aS'I was standing at the hallway wondering if I should go look for him, when a shadow appeared at its end and my body tried to jump out of my skin.'
p440
aS'It was him, of course. But my relief only lasted for a second. As he got closer, a prickling sense crept into my bones that something was wrong.'
p441
aS"He was stepping carefully, like over ice, deliberate, head turned down to the carpet. For a moment I wasn't sure it was him at all."
p442
aS"He noticed me, gave me the thinnest of smiles. Sweat beaded on his face, which was ashen, like he'd been throwing up. He grabbed my arm as if to keep from falling over. His hand was cold."
p443
aS'"You okay?" I asked.'
p444
aS'He nodded. "Yeah. Just need to go to bed."'
p445
aS'"Did you---" I wanted to say _see something down there_, but couldn\'t quite work up the nerve. "---have too much to drink or something?"'
p446
aS'He chuckled, weak. "Bed." He brushed passed me, and headed, wobbly, up the stairs.'
p447
aS"Chapter 4\n\nAfter that everything changed. He'd lost all interest in Downstairs. If I brought it up he'd change the subject; if folks were hanging out down there he wouldn't come."
p448
aS'When I finally asked him directly about this, he shook his head.'
p449
aS'"I don\'t think it\'s a good idea to be down there, that\'s all." He tried to play it off casual, but his jaw was set.'
p450
aS'Something about him had changed. His wardrobe turned straight-laced. He went back to calling himself Nick. He watched a lot of sports on TV.'
p451
aS"And things were strange between us. Our conversations didn't go quite right, didn't fit in their familiar grooves. We'd get derailed, trail off. We started talking less."
p452
aS"I couldn't point to something specific that had changed, but the usual pleasurable tension between us, the taut bond of connection we'd had since the accident, was gone. He didn't seem to need me any more. He seemed like just a dude."
p453
aS'Just a Nick. Not mine.'
p454
aS"I worked up my courage and did a few of my own solo expeditions Downstairs, without telling him, but I couldn't convince myself to go very far. I hallucinated strange noises around corners: floorboards creaking, whispered sighs."
p455
aS"I knew I was only scaring myself, but didn't have it in me to stay down there for long."
p456
aS"I lay on my bed a lot and listened to records through my headphones. My dad's old headphones: huge bulky black things with a coiled cord like old telephones. Sometimes I held my breath while I did it."
p457
aS'This was an old technique of mine to shut the world out. After a while outside sounds would slip away, and the thrum of blood and music would fill my ears, become my entire universe. As a kid I could hold my breath for three minutes.'
p458
aS'Enough sometimes to make it through a whole song without breathing.'
p459
aS'I fell asleep one night doing this, headphones on, and dreamed about Niko, which happened now and then whether I wanted it to or not. In the dream I was at the hallway junction again, looking down into the shadows at the figure at its end.'
p460
aS'There was only one this time: Niko, walking toward me. Not hesitant but confident, smiling, happy to see me.'
p461
aS'I grinned back, thrilling at the reciprocity between us, a bond that felt in that moment tinged with something else, something more primal.'
p462
aS"But then I faltered, because I realized I wasn't sure quite what that meant. There are a lot of primal emotions.\n\nThere were so many things that smile could mean."
p463
aS'I took a step back, afraid, but there was nothing but empty space behind me. I was standing at the lip of a drop-off.'
p464
aS'He came right up to me, Niko, my Niko, looking into my eyes with something I was certain now was love, and the fear faded as he reached up to touch my cheek,'
p465
aS'and the warmth of it and the smell of him and the look on his face fused inside me into need so intense it parted my lips, as if for oxygen, just as he bent down with hunger to kiss them.'
p466
aS"It was a beatific kiss, velvet, brain-melting, the kind you sometimes get in real life if you're lucky but I'd only ever had in dreams, sweet and lingering and seraphic."
p467
aS"Everything I'd ever wanted flowed through me into him and I imagined I could feel the same from him to me, echoed and amplified, conjoined. It went on and on and on."
p468
aS'He pressed against me, arms wrapped around my back, holding me, and mine were maybe around him too but only limply, subconscious, the kiss and its indescribable tangibility, its dream-forgotten trueness the only thing, the only thing.'
p469
aS"The only thing.\n\nIt wasn't until I'd broken it, pulled back to look up at him, that I realized I was leaning back over the edge behind me, his arms holding me there, my toes the only thing still touching the lip of the drop-off."
p470
aS"I couldn't read his expression. Had no idea what it meant at all.\n\nI didn't even know who he was."
p471
aS'He let me fall.'
p472
aS"I plummeted down into darkness, gathering speed, faster and faster. I'd had dreams before that ended like this, a sickening fall and then an ejection back to wakefulness right as I hit ground, covered in cold sweat and shuddering."
p473
aS"But this time when I woke, it was more like I'd chosen to do it, pulled away from the dream against its will. Like part of me knew if I'd stayed I'd have kept falling forever, because there was no ground down there to stop me."
p474
aS"The record was turning in its final groove. I stared at it dumbly, dad's big headphones still muffling the outside world, transmitting only hissing, clicks and pops."
p475
aS"_This has got to stop_, I told myself, _you're over him. You got over him a long time ago._ The accident had confused everything but in the months after it I'd sorted myself out, realized it was never going to happen."
p476
aS"Put it away and moved on. I had. It was just my fucking dreams didn't seem to have gotten the memo."
p477
aS'I felt Downstairs tingling at my back, beneath me. I switched the player off and took my blanket to sleep on the couch in the living room.'
p478
aS'* * *\n\nOne night not long after that, everyone but Niko and I had left for an overnight road trip. We started drinking, and it seemed to ease the friction between us, which made us both want to keep drinking.'
p479
aS'I took comfort in this, maybe the first acknowledgment that he felt the gap between us too, wanted as much as I did to find a way to close it.'
p480
aS'Deep into a bottle of vodka, we got into one of those hilarious drunken arguments about nothing: the final line to one of our favorite movies. I was sure it was one thing, he was sure it was something a few words off.'
p481
aS'I knew I was right, and also could see why he might remember it wrong, but he refused to believe me.'
p482
aS'He tried to pull out his cell phone to call a friend for a second opinion and got it stuck on something in his pocket: laughing,'
p483
aS"he ended up dumping everything out on the table, but then we got distracted by a text he'd gotten from an ex-girlfriend,"
p484
aS'which led to more drinking and another argument where I dutifully tried to keep him from responding, not just because he was drunk but because back then with those flip phones it would have taken him a fucking hour to peck out a reply.'
p485
aS'We ended up slumped in our chairs, the vodka bottle empty, listening to some spacey ambient music on the stereo.'
p486
aS'I had about drifted off when I\nshook myself awake. Niko was out cold. Before I could wake him and convince him to drag himself to bed I noticed something out of the corner of my eye.'
p487
aS"In the pile of stuff he'd pulled from his pocket (phone, wallet, keys, crumpled receipts) were two small brass keys.\n\nThey weren't on his keyring, just loose in his pocket, and faintly corroded with age."
p488
aS'It was hard to tell for sure, but they looked identical.'
p489
aS"Nothing about this was all that unusual but somehow I knew one of those keys would fit the fridge Downstairs. Don't ask how I knew this, because I couldn't tell you, but I did. Irrational."
p490
aS"That ridiculous locked fridge in that ridiculous kitchen atop a ridiculous empty pool.\n\nHe'd been keeping something from me too."
p491
aS'Had he found something in there?\n\nSomething that scared him off going back?'
p492
aS'What inside a fridge could be that scary? Could make him lie to his best friend?'
p493
aS"I'm not sure why I did it. The vodka, maybe. Repressed curiosity. Or maybe the growing frustration that something had happened to Niko, something had changed; but I wasn't allowed to know what it was, or ever put it right."
p494
aS"Quietly, I took the keys. I shouldn't have, but by then I already had."
p495
aS"* * *\n\nThe house was dead quiet, which made the transition to Downstairs feel even more natural. Despite my earlier trepidations, I wasn't afraid as I grabbed the flashlight by the hallway. Vodka is magic."
p496
aS"I passed through the first few hallways, the stairs where the lights went out, the dark lower corridors. It wasn't until I hit the hexagon that I got scared again."
p497
aS"I'd been walking on autopilot, lost in musing, but as I stepped into that room with its stairs leading down, I pulled up short. The flashlight was dimmer."
p498
aS"My eyes had adjusted, but through my liquor-addled head I noticed the room was still less bright than the last time I'd been down here.\n\nNiko must have run down the batteries with all his exploring."
p499
aS'This didn\'t especially worry me: after our first trip I\'d brought up this possibility. "Yeah, fuck that," he\'d said, and duct-taped four fresh batteries to the long body of the flashlight.'
p500
aS"But it did occur to me---now---that to change them down here I'd have to do it in total darkness. Fiddling with sticky tape, fumbling to unscrew the light, pouring out the old batteries and not mixing them up with the new ones, by feel..."
p501
aS'So there was that.'
p502
aS'I thought for a minute about going back. But I was close to the pool room now. I wanted to find out what was inside that fridge. What Niko had been keeping from me.'
p503
aS'And I did have the batteries, after all. If I needed to change them, it would just take a second.\n\nI kept going.'
p504
aS'The last set of stairs down, with their weird irrational angles, passed quickly. The hall at the bottom stretched into the gloom, and I sped past the long stretch with no doors till I reached the pool room.'
p505
aS'The door was closed. So Niko _had_ been back here.'
p506
aS'Inside was the smooth curved concrete of the pool bottom. I grabbed for the lowest rung of the ladder and pulled myself up, a familiar motion from my swimming days made unfamiliar through lack of buoyancy, being clothed and bone-dry.'
p507
aS'The upper level had a lip about three feet wide extending around the edge of the empty pool, and on the ladder side the space opened up, concrete giving way to linoleum.'
p508
aS'Sure enough, there was a full kitchen up there, just like Niko had described. With all the appliances, it was fairly cozy. I stared bemused at the chrome dials on the oven, the row of pale-green cabinets with round white handles.'
p509
aS'I turned to the fridge. It looked dated, a fading yellow with tacky chrome highlights. It only had one big door; no freezer. No magnets or family photos, either. Generically anonymous.'
p510
aS"I pulled at the handle, but it didn't budge. Studying it, I saw what Niko had been talking about: there was a small keyhole under the handle. Smaller than a house key: more like one for a padlock, something you'd put on a shed."
p511
aS"The keys I'd lifted from Niko looked about right."
p512
aS"I picked one and slid it into the lock. It went in smooth, with a satisfying click as it bottomed out. But when I turned it, it wouldn't rotate."
p513
aS'Frustrated, I jigged it back and forth, turning harder. The key was too small to get a solid grip on. I squeezed down and gave it a really good twist.'
p514
aS"For a second I thought it was turning, but then I realized I'd bent the key. I'd come close to snapping it in half."
p515
aS"I pulled it gingerly from the lock, staring at it in disappointment. Well, shit. There wouldn't be any hiding this from him now. It was bent nearly in half. I slipped it into my back pocket as I tried to think what to do."
p516
aS'In between the little noises I made, the taps and scratches and breaths, I felt the silence like a weight on my shoulders, pressing me down.\n\n_Try the other key._'
p517
aS'It slid in easy too, and when I gently twisted this one, it turned. I rotated it through a full three sixty before I heard a second snick.\n\nI pulled at the fridge handle and the door swung open, cold air and yellow light wafting out.'
p518
aS"I wasn't sure what I expected to see (_frozen heads_, the part of my brain still traumatized by horror movies suggested) so it took a moment of blinking in confusion to realize the fridge was empty."
p519
aS"There weren't even any shelves other than the one above the crisper drawers on the bottom, though the walls had notches where they should go. But no food. A butter dish and condiment nooks in the door, unused.\n\nThere was nothing in there."
p520
aS'Except---frowning, I bent down, shining the light inside. The fridge was _deep_. It went back a good six feet. And there was something on the back wall.'
p521
aS'The inside of another fridge door. Condiment nooks. Another butter dish.\n\n_What the hell?_'
p522
aS'Feeling foolish, I clambered inside, flashlight bumping against the plastic floor above two pairs of crisper drawers, one facing in, one facing out. They held my weight.'
p523
aS'I shuffled forward, hunched over (there was less than five feet of vertical space) and pushed the inner door. No give. I pushed harder, remembering stories about kids stuck in fridges, but still nothing. _Is this one locked too?_'
p524
aS"I searched for a keyhole, but didn't see one. _Which makes sense, if it's on the outside._ I turned back to confirm: yep, the door I'd come through had no sign of a lock on its inner surface."
p525
aS'The logo on the plastic butter compartment said Whirlpool.'
p526
aS"A thought popped into my head: _What if it's like an airlock?_ This made no kind of logical sense, but seemed compelling. Only one door open at a time, otherwise you'd let all the cold air out. I almost giggled, then stopped myself, afraid."
p527
aS'_What am I doing?_'
p528
aS"I decided to try it. Why not? Nothing made sense, so maybe this would, for lack of any better ideas. Turning awkwardly, I reached for the door I'd come through to pull it shut."
p529
aS"It wasn't designed to be pulled from the inside, but I got a grip on a condiment shelf and swung it firmly towards me."
p530
aS'As the door slammed shut two things happened, both terrifying in different ways. First, there were two snicks, one from the door in front of me and one behind.\n\nSecond, my flashlight went out.'
p531
aS"Cold terror flushed through me. I shook the light, pressed the button on and off. Nothing happened. I pushed the door in front of me but it didn't give at all."
p532
aS"I slammed into it hard with my whole body, panicking, the rounded edge of a plastic shelf jabbing into my cheekbone, but the door didn't budge."
p533
aS"_Because it's locked_, I told myself, mind whirling. _But the one behind you is open, now._ I twisted around, facing the back of the fridge as near I could tell, the second door."
p534
aS'But the thought of opening that door in pitch blackness, a door leading into complete unknown, opening it blind and crawling out into darkness, was terrifying. I stayed frozen, caught between fears: staying there or moving forward.'
p535
aS'Finally some combination of claustrophobia and visions of my air running out triumphed over my fear of the unknown. I crab-walked forward till my outstretched hand touched the other door.'
p536
aS'Before I could stop to think, I kept moving forward, pushing my weight against it.\n\nThe door opened easily and my flashlight came back on.'
p537
aS'_Like the fridge light_, I thought, dizzy. _Goes out when the door is closed, comes back when you open it. Makes perfect sense._ I actually laughed out loud and then stopped myself.'
p538
aS"I couldn't laugh. I had to take this seriously, while I was down here. Or I might never get out."
p539
aS'Stumbling on cramped knees, I spilled out of the fridge and staggered upright, shining my light around warily. But what I saw confused me even more.\n\nIt was the same room.'
p540
aS'I frowned, mind working, flashing the light over every surface like a brush that might paint sense into what I was seeing.'
p541
aS"It was the same kitchen---same ovens, same green cabinets, same improbably-adjacent concrete pool. Not a mirror image, or a slightly different design: it was the same room I'd just left."
p542
aS'The only difference was the fridge was on the opposite wall.\n\nLike it had connected through the wall to an identical room on the other side.'
p543
aS'Dizzy.'
p544
aS"I took a few steps forward, shined the light over the edge of the pool. Same ladder, same door, although it was shut. Had I shut it behind me this time? I'd been in a hurry. I couldn't remember.\n\nI turned back to the fridge, and froze."
p545
aS'The door had swung shut behind me.'
p546
aS"I pulled on the handle, but it didn't budge. Locked."
p547
aS"Shit. Where was the key? I'd left it in the lock on the other side. But the other one, the one I'd bent, the one that didn't fit, was still in my pocket."
p548
aS'I pulled it out again to frown at it, knowing somehow what would happen before I tried it. Sure enough, when I slipped the bent key into the lock and turned it, this time it rotated easily and the door swung open.'
p549
aS'Different key. Different lock. _Different door._\n\nDifferent room.'
p550
aS'I shut and locked it again, shaking my head.'
p551
aS'I had to see. I climbed down the ladder, dropped onto the concrete. I opened the door onto the doorless hallway.'
p552
aS"A wave of d\xc3\xa9j\xc3\xa0 vu hit me as I looked down it. It was the same hall I'd passed through minutes before---but I knew it couldn't be. I'd crawled out the other side of the fridge."
p553
aS"This wasn't the same place, and yet it had that ineffable tang of familiar places, the twinge that tells you _I've been here before_."
p554
aS'As I walked down the hallway, I looked for some distinguishing feature to confirm this intuition: but the decor was, as always, so bland that nothing stood out. It could have been any basement hallway anywhere.'
p555
aS'When I hit the stairs back up to the six-sided room, though, something went wrong.'
p556
aS"I'd stopped without meaning to, clutching the banister, foot on the first step. I looked up the stairs, and a faint twinge of vertigo brushed me. Or not vertigo, exactly. It's hard to describe."
p557
aS"It wasn't quite premonition, a sensation, a tingling, an insight. It wasn't like knowing or feeling at all.\n\nSomething inside me between emotion and intuition just didn't want to go back up there."
p558
aS"I had a sudden vivid flashback to a photo I'd seen as a kid, still confused about my burgeoning sexuality."
p559
aS"It was from an article in a news magazine about gay bashing: there'd been an upswing of murders everywhere, big cities and small towns."
p560
aS'The photo showed a chalk outline on a dirty sidewalk and next to it a spray-painted message, red and messy: "A Queer Died Here."'
p561
aS'I remember a wave of despair and horror washing over me as I stared at that picture, curdling the pulse-pounding fear of getting caught I always had when encountering something relating to my secret suspicions about myself.'
p562
aS"That was the first time I understood it wouldn't just be embarrassing or awkward to be gay, or found out as gay. There were people who would hate me for it, maybe even kill me. That was how wrong they thought I was."
p563
aS"To know just existing could make people feel that way about you, to realize that this was the world you'd have to live in, to keep growing up in. If you could."
p564
aS'The creeping feeling I felt now was like that. An existential wrongness. And it was getting stronger. Like a light from around a distant corner, growing brighter.'
p565
aS'I listened, motionless, but heard nothing. The quiet pressed me.'
p566
aS'_What am I going to do? Go back?_\n\nNo.'
p567
aS'Taking a deep breath, I made an impulsive decision. A few paces back was a door, and without stopping to think I pulled it open. The room inside was crammed with furniture under sheets.'
p568
aS'On a normal day this might have scared the piss out of me, but this feeling of wrongness was getting so strong I would have run straight into a room full of oversized spiders rather than stay in that hallway any longer.'
p569
aS'I slipped in and shut the door behind me, quietly---that felt important---and ran to the far end of the room. Spotting something sofa-shaped, I lifted the edge of the sheet that covered it and half-crawled, half-dived inside.'
p570
aS"Flipping onto my back, I smoothed the sheet, held my hand over the flashlight---I couldn't bear to turn it off---and held my breath."
p571
aS'The feeling had diminished when I ran across the room, but now was growing again. I was trembling. I tried not to breathe, to relax my face as if doing so would open my ears wider, let me hear fainter sounds.'
p572
aS'It was deathly quiet. All I could hear was my heartbeat.\n\nThe top of my hand glowed a dull red as the flashlight beam lit up bones and the dark veins between them.'
p573
aS"The feeling reached an unbearable crescendo, and held there sustained. I was shivering and couldn't stop. It was a wrongness, wrongness on every level, filling me up. I wanted it to go away more than anything."
p574
aS'I thought I heard something move in the hallway outside. Scuffing the carpet, maybe.\n\nThen, mercifully, the feeling started to drain away.'
p575
aS"I let out a breath, then took in another. With each one I felt more in balance, an equilibrium I'd never thought to appreciate until now. In another minute, all that was left was me: coated in sweat, crashing off adrenaline, but all right."
p576
aS'And yeah, it took fifteen minutes to muster the courage to lift the sheet and walk back across that room. Now that my regular instincts were back, the thought of what might be under all those other sheets was fucking terrifying.'
p577
aS"* * *\n\nWhen I'd recovered, I hurried across the room, out into the hall, and back up the stairs."
p578
aS'My brain had gone numb: I let myself feel like I was retracing my steps, but another part of me knew I moved through different halls and rooms, on the wrong side of the fridge.'
p579
aS"But going back would mean following the direction that ugly feeling had drifted---and I couldn't do that."
p580
aS'So I climbed the stairs to the hexagon room, through the identical hallways back, and up the second stairs to the lighted upper levels, everything exactly as it should have been.\n\nWhen I saw the coffee stain, though, I stopped.'
p581
aS"It was right where Niko had spilled it on our first trip down, where the coffee had sloshed as he'd forced open the sticky door."
p582
aS"It was the same hallway. But I couldn't explain how."
p583
aS'What had happened? My brain whirred, trying to manufacture sense.'
p584
aS'What I finally decided was this: I must have gotten turned around in the dark fridge. Banging the inside of the door, trying to force it open, I somehow moved the fridge, pushed it across the kitchen to the opposite wall.'
p585
aS"When I came out, it was through the other door, but into the same room. And I must have gotten confused about the keys: maybe I hadn't turned the first one the right way when I tried it, that was all."
p586
aS"I couldn't honestly convince myself of this.\n\n_It's the same coffee stain._"
p587
aS'I felt superimposed. It had to be the same hallway, and yet it had to be a different one. This was the same stain, and yet I was a ten-minute walk from where Niko had spilled his coffee.'
p588
aS"I kept going. I made it back to the big room, looking just as I'd left it, and climbed the final stairs gingerly. But my room was waiting for me at the top, nothing out of place: my records, my textbooks, my dirty laundry."
p589
aS"That settled that. Somehow, I'd come back the same way I went in. But I felt deflated, unresolved, like the last fifty pages of the book had been left out. _And then he: The End._"
p590
aS'I shut the bed behind me more firmly than necessary. I considered nailing it shut but settled for piling some heavy boxes on top of it.'
p591
aS"It had been maybe an hour since I'd left. Niko was still passed out on the couch in our front room."
p592
aS'I curled up on the next couch over and, despite being so keyed up I could barely think, dropped into sleep.'
p593
aS'* * *\n\nI woke some time later to Niko shaking my shoulder, and sat up, bleary-eyed. It was still dark outside.\n\n"Go to bed," he was saying, "it\'s late."'
p594
aS"I yawned. The trip Downstairs seemed like a dream, coming back in bits and pieces. I snuck a glance at the corner of the table where he'd emptied his pockets, but his stuff was gone. Did he notice I'd taken the keys?"
p595
aS"Shit. I'd have to tell him."
p596
aS'"Hey man," I said, dreading this. "You remember earlier when you pulled your shit out to get your phone, and left it on the table?"'
p597
aS'He blinked. "Um. No."'
p598
aS'He\'d been pretty drunk. I pressed on. "We were about halfway through finishing that bottle." The vodka bottle was about a quarter full. I frowned. Hadn\'t we killed it?'
p599
aS'Shaking my head, I pressed on. "Look. What I\'m trying to say is, I took the keys. I\'m sorry. I just wanted to know if you\'d found something down there. Why you hadn\'t told me.'
p600
aS'I went but there was nothing there, and I got turned around and... anyway, it doesn\'t matter. I screwed up and I lost one key, and uh, kind of damaged the other."'
p601
aS'It sounded so stupid as I said it, and I hated myself, both for stealing from him and for failing to discover anything useful with them. "I\'m an idiot, man, and I\'m sorry.'
p602
aS'But look, if you tell me where you found them, maybe we could figure something out, and talk about what\'s going on, and everything?"'
p603
aS"Niko was frowning, but didn't seem angry. Maybe this wasn't going to be a big deal after all.\n\nHe sat down on the floor next to me, a serious look on his face."
p604
aS'"Orion," he said, "exactly what fucking keys are you talking about?"'
p605
aS'Chapter 5\n\nThe next few minutes unspooled with growing panic, like a harpoon in a speared sea monster diving deeper and deeper.'
p606
aS"Niko said he'd never found any keys. And as I tried to piece together the evening, to backtrace what had happened, little details kept failing to add up. The vodka bottle."
p607
aS'The movie quote: now he agreed with me, was baffled that I thought he could possibly get it wrong. He pulled out his phone and showed me the last text from his ex: four months ago.'
p608
aS'Despite these discrepancies, something felt right about the way we discussed them. We were back in sync again. The strained awkwardness and stunted conversations of the last week were gone.'
p609
aS"It felt like he'd been away on a trip and we were catching up again, despite the fact that we'd been seeing each other all week."
p610
aS"But when I told him where I'd been that night, about the fridge and the keys, it was like I'd punched him in the face."
p611
aS'He bolted up, took a few paces, then collapsed into a chair, stricken. "Oh, shit," he kept saying. "Oh shit oh shit oh shit."'
p612
aS"He wouldn't say anything else until I poured him another shot of vodka---the vodka we'd already finished, goddammit---and then the story started breaking out of him in dangerous pieces."
p613
aS'"Remember the night of the party?" He looked drained. "I didn\'t feel like talking, you know, to other humans. So I went exploring. Had a vague thought like maybe I\'d find something interesting to bring back up and show you."'
p614
aS'He ran a shaky hand through his kinked hair. "But something..." He swallowed. "Something happened, okay? And I got to the pool room and I couldn\'t go back the same way." He waved a hand at my raised eyebrow.'
p615
aS'"Let me just finish telling this, okay?"'
p616
aS"He wouldn't say what had happened, but it made him change course, and eventually he found himself approaching the pool room door from the other direction."
p617
aS'He climbed the ladder into the kitchen, but when he got there found the fridge not only unlocked, but open---the outer door, at least.'
p618
aS"He'd done the same thing I had: climbed inside, pulled the door shut, lost his light, pushed the other door open---and climbed out with the same spatial confusion I'd had."
p619
aS'I told him my theory about knocking the fridge around, but he shook his head. "No, I don\'t think so. When my light went out, I was pretty deliberate with my motions, exactly because I didn\'t want to get turned around.'
p620
aS'I barely jostled the thing. And there\'s something else that makes me think..."'
p621
aS'He swallowed, licked his lips. For a long minute, he couldn\'t meet my eye. Then he grabbed my knee, as if to steady himself, looked over at me. Looked hard. "Ryan. Man. This is going to sound crazy. But listen, okay? This place.'
p622
aS'This house." He looked around furtively, as if we were someplace dangerous and not the living room of our college crash pad. "We\'re not where we used to be. _This is a different place._"'
p623
aS'"Step off," I said, rejecting this at once. "It\'s one thing to say there\'s a couple mirrored hallways down there, but there\'s not a whole different house up here.'
p624
aS'There aren\'t clones of our goddamn roommates, a different street and sky and..."'
p625
aS'I trailed off, because he was staring at me, miserable. I realized this was exactly what he thought was happening.'
p626
aS'"Look," I said, worried and afraid, "let\'s go back right now. I\'ll show you the coffee stain. That proves it."'
p627
aS'"I\'m not going back down there." He pulled back. "I\'ve been too damn terrified to even think about it, after what I..." He bit his lip, looked away. Took the last swig of vodka.'
p628
aS'Tingles crawled down my neck. "What you saw? Well, what was it?"'
p629
aS"He didn't answer for a while. I thought he was trying to remember at first, and then maybe that he was trying to forget."
p630
aS'Finally, defeated, he told me. "On my way down. Before I got there. I started feeling... off. Like something was wrong."'
p631
aS'"That happened to me, too. I hid in a side room and waited, and after a while it went away."'
p632
aS'"Yeah," he said weakly, "probably what I should have done. You know me, man. I ignored it. I kept going. And..."'
p633
aS'He stopped, trembling. Phantom insects crawled up my back. What did he see to rattle him this bad?'
p634
aS'"That long hallway. Without any doors. I was walking down it, and I saw another light."'
p635
aS'I sat rigid. "What the fuck?"'
p636
aS'"I kept walking," he went on, not looking at me. "I didn\'t want to turn my back, get chased down. That sick feeling got stronger. Sharper. But I couldn\'t stop walking. Couldn\'t turn around."'
p637
aS'He took a deep breath. "The light got closer. It was someone with a flashlight. They were walking toward me the same way I was walking toward them. I couldn\'t see their face. I just kept walking.'
p638
aS'I kind of hugged the right wall and they hugged the left. The flashlight was right in my face. I couldn\'t see anything until we were only a few steps apart."'
p639
aS"He met my gaze at last, forehead wet with cold sweat, like he was reliving that queasy sensation. My own stomach twisted. I couldn't breathe."
p640
aS'"Ry," he said, "I passed myself. I walked right past another me with another flashlight, who looked as sick and fucked up as I did. And we both kept walking. We didn\'t stop.'
p641
aS'I made it to the pool room, climbed the ladder, and went right through that fucking fridge to get farther away. And there is no fucking way I\'m going back down there again."'
p642
aS'I swallowed. "Dude. It was dark. You were messed up. Maybe you saw someone else down there, but what you\'re saying, man. It\'s impossible."'
p643
aS'"Irrational." A hollow laugh. "Things are different here. I\'ll show you. What\'s the smallest bill you\'ve got in your wallet?"'
p644
aS'"Uh, I don\'t know." Taken aback, I pulled it out, riffled through the smaller bills. He smiled grimly at one of them, snatched it, held it up.'
p645
aS'"Better hold onto this. Because no one here\'s ever heard of one."'
p646
aS'"What are you talking about?" I said, annoyed.\n\nAnd over the next hour, he showed me.'
p647
aS'We pored through the dusty encyclopedia in our front foyer. We combed the magazines sitting in the house, dragged out Monopoly.'
p648
aS'We fired up the Internet (all GeoCities and tedium in those days) and found pictures of cash registers, government websites, coin collectors talking about the history of currency.'
p649
aS'According to everything we could find, the US Government had never, at any point in its history, issued a three dollar bill as legal tender.'
p650
aS'We stared at the one from my wallet with growing unease. Buchanan\'s familiar portrait stared back, implacable. Niko tapped the portrait\'s chin. "That right there might be the only one that exists in this place. Wherever we are."'
p651
aS'* * *\n\nWe cobbled together a theory out of guesswork and dreams.'
p652
aS'If Downstairs had two sides---two versions, or halves, or whatever---then Niko had passed into the other one the night of the party, through the unlocked fridge.'
p653
aS'The Niko I saw stumbling out of the hall that night, sick and wanting sleep, was the wrong Niko. A different Niko. The one my Niko had passed in the hall.'
p654
aS"And that Niko didn't quite fit in. Everything was a little off about him, and from his perspective, I suppose, about me."
p655
aS"But that Niko had found two keys. We had no idea where he'd found them."
p656
aS"But if he'd passed through the fridge with one of them---"
p657
aS'and here I will compress the part where we opened another bottle of vodka rather than accept the ridiculousness of this garbage fairy tale premise where a magical Frigidaire is a gateway between worlds,'
p658
aS'slept it off,'
p659
aS'suffered through ugly hangovers the next day, and reconvened late in the afternoon with some Aspirin---if the other Niko came through the fridge just before my Niko had,'
p660
aS'that could explain why my Niko had found it unlocked and open, was able to pass through.'
p661
aS"And earlier---if we followed this chain of logic---I'd been drinking from a different vodka bottle, in a different house, with that other Niko. The one with the keys."
p662
aS"I'd stolen them and passed through to this side of Downstairs---the wrong side---and maybe some other me had been doing the same thing."
p663
aS'I only avoided him by my sudden detour, when I sensed something wrong up ahead and ducked into the side room with the sheet-covered furniture, to let him pass by.'
p664
aS'And now we were both in the wrong house, on the opposite side from where we\'d started.\n\n"And both of them are on the wrong side, too," Niko said, still wincing from the hangover.'
p665
aS'I licked my lips, head also still spinning, wondering if it would be okay to take two more Aspirin. Or four more. "But these other two, if they exist." I still couldn\'t quite surrender to this madness.'
p666
aS'"They could come back any time they wanted, right? And so could we."'
p667
aS'"Because the key\'s still in the lock on their side." Niko frowned. "And you\'ve got the one for this side. Both keys are back where they should be now. One for us and one for them."\n\n"Unless there are two keys for this side too."'
p668
aS'"No. You said the first one you tried didn\'t work, even though it looked the same? I think there\'s exactly two keys. One for each side. The other me ended up with both, somehow.'
p669
aS'I guess if he found one and went through, he\'d know right where to look for the second."\n\nWe stared at each other.'
p670
aS'"What does that mean?" I asked.'
p671
aS'"I have no fucking idea. But shit, man, I\'m glad you\'re here." He ran a hand through his curls, face pale. "I seriously wasn\'t handling this on my own. This whole last week, things weren\'t right.'
p672
aS'_You_ weren\'t right, and I couldn\'t stand that, man. I was going crazy without you. Doubting everything, you know how I get. Doubting who I even was. But this, this is..."'
p673
aS'He waved his hand back and forth between the two of us, then knocked it on the table. "You get me. We\'re tight. Yeah? In it together, I mean. It\'s good. I\'m glad."'
p674
aS"I didn't say anything, but I didn't have to. I felt the same way and he knew it."
p675
aS"I slept in his room that night, in a sleeping bag beside his bed. He didn't want to be alone. I'd kind of wanted some time to process everything but I didn't protest too much. I liked being his anchor."
p676
aS"He kept us both up late talking about random bullshit, rambling. It was okay. Everything was upside down. Old comforts couldn't hurt."
p677
aS"* * *\n\nWe slept in the next day. Call me a coward, but buried in my sleeping bag I could pretend I wasn't in the wrong universe."
p678
aS"Things were definitely wrong. Now that I was looking, I couldn't deny it. Familiar people acted strange in a way you couldn't put your finger on. Colors seemed indefinably different shades."
p679
aS'A vague sense of off-ness suffused everything, like a movie with the sound a frame out of sync.'
p680
aS"After looking more closely, things were off about my room. There was an unfamiliar dress shirt on a hanger. My copy of Samuel Delany's _Dhalgren_ was missing, along with all the other books of his I'd discovered after reading that one."
p681
aS"It wasn't quite my room, I realized. It was someone else's."
p682
aS"It was mostly little things, so we grasped at each quantitative difference, each change we could pin down. One night one of our housemates kept saying something I didn't understand."
p683
aS'She was going on about getting a parking ticket and kept saying it was the "fourth fucking time" it had happened.\n\n"What\'s that word you\'re saying?"'
p684
aS'"Fucking," she clarified, unhelpfully.'
p685
aS'"No," I said. "Count up in ordinals. You know first, second..."'
p686
aS'She blinked at me. "First, second, third, fourth, fifth."'
p687
aS'Fourth. Instead of fourd.\n\nThings were different here.'
p688
aS'We didn\'t find too many obvious changes. People said "potato bugs" now instead of "doodlebugs." I saw a periodic table hanging in the sciences building and something seemed off about it, but I couldn\'t put my finger on what.'
p689
aS"Usually we weren't quite sure whether something had actually changed, or we were losing our goddamn minds."
p690
aS"We danced around it for a while, but finally the phrase came out: parallel universes. But it didn't really satisfy. Why these two universes in particular, out of a supposedly infinite number?"
p691
aS'Why were they connected via a series of poorly decorated basement rooms and linked together by a refrigerator, of all things?'
p692
aS"At one point, feeling overwhelmed, I called home---not to tell mom what was happening because I didn't want her to freak, just to hear her voice---but the answering machine said they were on vacation till the end of the month."
p693
aS'This was annoying both because I hadn\'t heard about any long vacation, and because "we" presumably meant her and my sister, and for some reason I hadn\'t been invited, which made me feel even more out of place and abandoned.'
p694
aS'I was three hours away, not on a different planet.'
p695
aS"Feeling rejected, I went record shopping, adding a couple hundred dollars to my already terrifying credit card debt in exchange for a small stack of LPs. Lately I'd gotten obsessed with sci-fi audio book recordings."
p696
aS'I found a few treasures at my usual haunts: Leonard Nimoy reading Ray Bradbury, and a six-record set of one of the Dune novels, read by Frank Herbert himself, still shrink-wrapped.'
p697
aS"More and more I only bought stuff in its original wrapping, unopened, sleeves protected from scuffs and wear marks, the records inside unplayed and undamaged, which is how I'd keep them."
p698
aS'Dad was the one who got me into records, back when I was still a kid and he was the most amazing person in the world.'
p699
aS"He took me to Disneyland, just the two of us (I don't remember now why mom and my sister weren't there),"
p700
aS'and we stayed late to see the Main Street Electrical Parade, and on our way out, way past my bedtime, he got me the record, my first record.'
p701
aS'I have eight different versions of that album now, six still in their original shrink-wrap.'
p702
aS"That first one I played so much it got scratched beyond belief, had to be constantly nudged forward out of stuck grooves, the cardboard sleeve beat to hell and back. I've still got that one, too."
p703
aS"I'd idolized dad."
p704
aS"He'd worked for the Department of Agriculture, which doesn't sound that glamorous but was legendary in my mind: my understanding of his job was that he traveled around the country helping farmers grow food better,"
p705
aS'the food that everyone in the country ate, and to me that was as noble and heroic as being an astronaut.'
p706
aS'Because of his job we had to move every couple years, and so I never really had any long-term friends. Except him.'
p707
aS'My sister and I were never that close---even as kids, our interests were too different---but dad and I, we understood each other. We were always there for each other.'
p708
aS'Maybe it was because of what happened with dad that I got so needy with my friendships later on, desperate to hold on to them. I either wanted to be your best friend in the world or not interact with you at all.'
p709
aS"That wasn't a recipe for a healthy social life in high school. I had a few friendships, here and there, but they didn't last: I'd cling too hard and people would drift away. Niko, I guess, was the first one who ever clung back."
p710
aS'Thank god I had him back again.'
p711
aS'We stayed close, maybe inevitably now that we were the only matching pair in this entire universe. It felt easy to be closer to him, for us both to need each other. It felt right. A relief from the wrongness all around us.'
p712
aS'He thought my airlock idea had legs. Downstairs was made from house-stuff: hallways and empty rooms and appliances. A fridge was one of the few devices in that context that could maintain a seal.'
p713
aS"It was a cute concept except it didn't actually explain anything.\n\nIt took a long time to convince him we needed to go back down."
p714
aS'"Maybe we can just stay here, and they can stay there," he said. "So everything\'s off a little. So what? It felt way more wrong to get close to..." He waved a hand. "Him. Whoever. My handsome twin.'
p715
aS'So maybe we should leave well enough alone. Brick the fucker up and never look back."\n\nThen the headaches started.'
p716
aS'They were odd headaches. Not severe. A tinge of nausea and dizziness, like stepping off one of those fairground rides that whirls you around, and only a very distant pain. They came and went. But I took them as an ominous sign.'
p717
aS"Niko said he'd been getting them all week. Oh. And they'd been getting stronger."
p718
aS"So the headaches more than anything convinced us. We had to go back down, try to get back through. Or maybe there were other points of connection. We'd barely started exploring. There was so much left."
p719
aS'But first we had to solve what Niko called the Mere Paradox. He threw a spoon at me when I said this back to him.'
p720
aS'"No, smart-ass. A _Mirror_ Paradox. We\'re obviously in this creepy weird sync with them." We were in his room with the door shut, and he was pacing the two-and-a-half steps of cleared floor while I lay on his bed, thinking. "Example.'
p721
aS'Me and the other Niko both went exploring on the same night. The other side, the other house, they were having a party that night too. We both saw that. The decor, uh, such as it was, was the same on both sides, or close enough.'
p722
aS'He and I were so synced up that we got to the fridge only minutes apart. He beat me, so he came through first, and then we passed in the hall."'
p723
aS'He stopped pacing, shuddered, and drummed his fingers on a bulky MIDI keyboard propped up against a wall gathering dust. "Two. A week later, both pairs of us end up getting drunk off vodka on the same night.'
p724
aS"Oh, there's these little differences---one side finishes the bottle, the other doesn't, and this me didn't get a certain text message that night---but both versions of you decide to go exploring."
p725
aS'Again, you get to the pool room only minutes apart. For the most part it\'s like we\'re staying in a kind of lockstep, despite the superficial differences."\n\n"Your conclusion, professor."'
p726
aS'"If we go down to explore, they will too. We meet in the middle, and bam." He shook his head. "Exactly what we don\'t want to happen." He saw I was still confused, so he scribbled two arrows on his whiteboard, pointed right at each other.'
p727
aS'"The fridge is the connection point. The only way each pair of us can get back, so far as we know. But if we go back there, so will they. It\'s like we\'re trapped on two sides of a mirror.'
p728
aS'We each want to touch it, but we can\'t do it at the same time."\n\n"Would it really be so bad?"'
p729
aS'He glared down at me. "You don\'t trust that feeling? I got a lot closer than you, and man, it was the worst.'
p730
aS'I don\'t know what was causing it or why, but every part of my body was screaming something was wrong, was sick, was going to harm me." He sighed and flopped down next to me. "So meeting ourselves is out.'
p731
aS'No choosing between having to fuck or fight yourself."\n\n"Which would you do?"'
p732
aS'"I would definitely fuck myself," he said, solemn. "You?"'
p733
aS'I wrinkled my nose. "Ugh. Neither. I think both of us would take one look at each other and back away in mortified embarrassment."'
p734
aS'"Sounds about right. So if we can\'t get close to each other, but trying to cross through will bring us together, then what do we do?"'
p735
aS'"Okay, so we explore at random." I sat up. "Every branch, we roll dice. Even if the others are in sync and pick the same time to explore, they\'ll go down different paths."'
p736
aS'He shook his head. "I think the lockstep runs deeper than that. Even randomness could be part of it. The coffee stain. Remember? We both passed the one on this side, coming out. That\'s what made you assume you were in the same place.'
p737
aS'Because it was identical, right? If both versions of me spilled coffee and both made exactly the same stain, I bet dice would fall the same way too."'
p738
aS'"How do we know it\'s identical? Did you really stop and look that close?"'
p739
aS'That got him. Niko would jump off a bridge to win an argument. A few minutes later we were headed back down the stairs, keeping up a forced light banter.'
p740
aS"It helped that the coffee stain was close to the surface, and far enough away from the fridge that even if the others went down at the same time, to look at their stain, we'd be nowhere near each other."
p741
aS'No one had cleaned up after the party---in fact, the other housemates had stopped coming down here at all, inexplicably---so there were still Christmas lights and red plastic cups strewn around the big room. Weirdly comforting.'
p742
aS'We retraced our first trip through the upper hallways to the coffee stain, and got down on hands and knees to study it. I immediately felt foolish.'
p743
aS'"This won\'t prove anything. We never looked at the original this close." I shrugged. "I don\'t know. It looks the same to me."'
p744
aS'"But exactly the same?" Niko bent closer, excited. "No, I don\'t think so. I don\'t remember this trail of droplets off to the side here. Do you?"'
p745
aS'We argued about it for a few minutes, but it was like grabbing soap in a bathtub.'
p746
aS"I'd read enough textbooks about memory and perception to know neither of us could accurately recall specifics of the other stain---it was weeks since we'd seen it and the details hadn't seemed important at the time."
p747
aS'I got up, shaking my head. "What is this even meant to prove? Does it matter if they\'re identical or not?"'
p748
aS'"It matters," he said emphatically, "because if it\'s exactly the same then the two sides are in total lockstep. We can\'t do anything different from them and they can\'t do anything different from us.'
p749
aS'But if the stains are different---even just a little---then there\'s a chance to break out of the pattern. Do something unique. That could be huge."'
p750
aS'"But we know we\'re not exactly in sync," I said. "For one thing, they somehow found keys down here. We never did that. They know things we don\'t, which means they\'re factoring that knowledge into their plans right now."'
p751
aS'"Like where they found them in the first place," he said, rubbing his temples. "Right."'
p752
aS'We sat in the hall for a minute in glum silence. I stared at the coffee stain, like it was an inkblot that would resolve into something sensible if I could make my mind work the right way.'
p753
aS'"There\'s other differences," I said. "When I went down, I felt like something was wrong, and I went and hid like a baby. The other version of me didn\'t do that. We did different things."'
p754
aS'"Yeah," he said, closing his eyes. "I\'m actually worried about that."\n\n"You were just saying you wanted us to be unique."'
p755
aS'He rubbed his forehead. Maybe he was getting another headache. "The two sides are nearly identical, as far as we can tell. The two versions of us are nearly identical too. So far, at least. But I don\'t know.'
p756
aS'Maybe if we start acting different, if we diverge too far..."\n\n"What?"'
p757
aS'He shrugged. "Don\'t know. Just a thought. Probably garbage, never mind."'
p758
aS'I closed my eyes and leaned my head back against the wall.'
p759
aS'* * *\n\nNiko was scared. He stayed close to me almost all the time, hanging out in my room, by the TV, wherever I was.'
p760
aS'This was a familiar pattern, actually: whenever he got overwhelmed he made me his full-time validator, babbling his interior monologue, running every decision big and small by me, ending most sentences with "Right?" or "Yeah?"'
p761
aS"It was like outsourcing his ego. I let him do it, like I always did, because it felt good to have him need me that much. But I felt guilty, too, because it couldn't be healthy."
p762
aS'We kept talking,\nand our half-assed theories began to crystallize into a plan.'
p763
aS'We rounded up a bunch of dice, some tarot and playing cards, loose change, a dreidel, and a stack of books, and devised a procedure---a ridiculously complicated procedure lasting almost an hour---to end up with two numbers,'
p764
aS'after several dozen iterations: the first between one and twenty-four, and the second between one and sixty.'
p765
aS'An hour, and a minute.'
p766
aS'The theory was that even if both sides were so close even randomness tended to turn out the same, if we stacked that randomness on top of itself, compounding chance on chance, it might be a wedge to split that sameness apart.'
p767
aS'Niko showed me a tiny video on his computer about strange attractors, said this was chaos theory in action, the butterfly effect. Whatever. We were making wild guesses.'
p768
aS"But the hope was that even if the other versions of us were doing the exact same thing---following an identical procedure---their numbers would drift apart and they'd end up generating a completely different time."
p769
aS'Which would allow each pair of us to pass through without crossing paths.'
p770
aS'So we had a plan. We just needed a time.'
p771
aS'* * *\n\n"In hindsight," Niko said, throwing back the last of the coffee and smacking his lips, "maybe we should have put a range on the fucking numbers. Dear god. I have a midterm in five hours."'
p772
aS"It was just after three in the morning, and we were prepping to go down. The time we'd generated was 3:41. We hoped for their sake the guys on the other side got something more reasonable."
p773
aS'Niko was in a rough mood, and it wasn\'t just the time of day. His old jock friends had been ragging him about not hanging out. ("I have to pretend sports bloopers are funny, Ry. It\'s horrible.")'
p774
aS"Later he'd gotten a call from one or both of his parents about how his degree was progressing, which had not gone well."
p775
aS'He spent the rest of the day in his room with the door shut blaring loud music and, apparently, watching a _Friends_ marathon. Every time I listened at his door I kept hearing Joey say "How _you_ doin\'?" Laugh track.'
p776
aS'Maybe he was just watching the same episode on repeat. Late that night I knocked again and reminded him we had a three a.m. date. A long and mournful stream of cuss words came muffled through the door.'
p777
aS'After an ominous silence he opened it, looking bleak. "Whose stupid idea was this again?" he asked, then grimly set his alarm.'
p778
aS"We'd planned a quick trip in and out, to minimize the chance of overlapping times. Once we passed through and got back up to the surface, our surface, we'd leave the house and stay away until the next day."
p779
aS"The campus library stayed open all night and if you had a book in your lap they wouldn't usually hassle you for sleeping. The next morning, we'd come back home, the headaches would be gone, and everything would be back to normal."
p780
aS'It made sense, except we were making it all up and had no idea if any of this would work or if we were playing make-believe.'
p781
aS'Swinging up the bed did feel ominous now, though. I noticed for the first time that it creaked. Stupid.'
p782
aS'We were girded up with supplies even though it was supposed to be a quick trip---three flashlights each, water bottles, even granola bars.'
p783
aS'Niko had a pad of yellow sticky notes and flipped the edges of it compulsively, nervous: "in case we need to mark our way," he explained.'
p784
aS"We'd never seen anything dangerous down there, exactly. We just knew something wasn't right, now. That it wasn't just a basement down there."
p785
aS'_We knew._ We knew nothing. The truth is that despite our attempts to rationalize, to explain, we were blind. Shooting in the dark. Grasping at straws from sci-fi movies and bad dreams.\n\nWe had no idea what was happening to us.'
p786
aS'We headed down, quietly so as not to wake our housemates. Once we got Downstairs, we followed the well-beaten path toward the room with the pool and the fridge.'
p787
aS'Niko was jumpy, especially when we got to the first staircase into the dark zone. Every shadow seemed ominous and he muttered suspicions at everything. "I think this door moved," or, "Someone\'s been here, I can feel it."'
p788
aS'I tried my best to keep things light, to reassure him. He started idly doodling flip-book animations of a gruesome hanging on the pad of sticky notes.'
p789
aS'On our way down the twisting stairs to the hexagon room, he stopped at one landing and glanced down the hall branching off from it. With a choke, he stiffened and leapt back, gripping the flashlight like a sword.'
p790
aS'"Jesus fucking Christ," he hissed. "What the shit is that?"\n\nI looked.'
p791
aS'Way down the hallway, past the reach of the flashlight, were two tiny glints, hovering maybe four feet off the ground, deep in the darkness.'
p792
aS"My heart rate was through the roof and I couldn't breathe, but I raised my flashlight too, shined it down the hall. It revealed nothing but the glints. I felt paralyzed. But I saw how scared Niko was. How close both of us were to panic."
p793
aS'I gave him a mock salute. "Later, skater," I said, and started down the hall.'
p794
aS'"The fuck are you doing?" Niko hissed from behind me. But I kept moving. I kept walking forward, eyes fixed on the glints, willing my light to get stronger, willing those eyes to resolve into something explainable, something benign.'
p795
aS'"Shit," Niko said, and followed me. "Shit shit shit."\n\nIt only took a few more steps before we realized our mistake.'
p796
aS'The hall ended in a T-junction. About four feet off the floor was one of those fake candelabra. The glints had been our flashlights, reflecting off its dull metal sheen.'
p797
aS'I laughed; it was easy with all the relief flooding through me. "See? There\'s enough weird shit going on without jumping at shadows."'
p798
aS'Niko forced a laugh out too, but his face was still pale and tense. "How could you tell? From back there?"'
p799
aS'I shrugged. "I couldn\'t. This was the quickest way to find out."'
p800
aS'"Great. My hero. Glad you weren\'t mauled by a shadowbear." But he was smiling now for real, and looking at me with respect.'
p801
aS"_He was right. That was stupid. Bravado is exactly the wrong response to what's happening._"
p802
aS'"Let\'s hurry and get this over with." We walked back to the landing. Niko wrote "NOT THIS WAY" on a sticky note and slapped it on the wall, drawing an arrow down the hall.'
p803
aS'I added a smiley face; he grabbed the pen back and drew some demon eyebrows on it.'
p804
aS'We made it the rest of the way to the pool room without incident, and climbed the ladder.'
p805
aS'I was on edge, waiting for any signs of that sick feeling of wrongness, but nothing happened, and there were no creepy doppelg\xc3\xa4ngers waiting for us above the lip of the pool.'
p806
aS'"Okay," Niko said, clapping his hands: he was spooked too, I could tell. "Let\'s do this. You want to do the honors?"'
p807
aS'I pulled out the bent key and slipped it into the lock, turned it. It rotated with a smooth snick. I pulled the handle, and as I tugged the fridge door open past the familiar suction, the light inside came on.'
p808
aS'Niko let out a strangled gasp and bent down, staring inside the door in horror. I stood frozen, still gripping the handle, unable to process what my eyes were telling me.'
p809
aS'Because inside was no longer a vinyl-padded room and the inside of another door. Instead, we were staring down a smooth, white, rectangular tunnel, that went on and on as far as we could see.'
p810
aS'Chapter 6\n\n"What the fuck is this?" Niko hissed. I didn\'t have an answer. We stared into the bright white hallway like it was a road to heaven, or to hell.'
p811
aS"The first few feet were the same as when we'd passed through before, the same as the interior of any ordinary fridge. Vinyl walls, plastic crisper drawers below the clear floor, a tiny bright bulb in the ceiling. But it didn't end."
p812
aS'It kept going. Every few feet another little white bulb above; vinyl walls extending farther and farther; and an endless highway of clear plastic shelf for a floor, eight inches above the vinyl floor.'
p813
aS'The lines extended to a perfect vanishing point, and for as far as we could see, nothing changed.'
p814
aS'For the next few hours, we did our best to interrogate this new unwanted truth, but gained no new understanding, came no closer to reconciling it with our plans to go back through.'
p815
aS'First we threw some wadded-up sticky notes and granola bars down the tunnel. When nothing happened to them, we ventured inside.'
p816
aS'Walking was hard: the ceiling was too low to stand up straight, so you had to move forward in an awkward shuffle.'
p817
aS"We only made it a hundred feet in before we had to turn back: Niko had been looking over his shoulder every few seconds to make sure the door back out hadn't vanished while we'd turned our backs on it,"
p818
aS'and eventually bumped his head one too many times on the ceiling and had a full-on claustrophobic panic attack.'
p819
aS'We retreated, hearts racing and muscles cramping. The next hundred feet had looked just as identical, anyway.'
p820
aS'We tried locking the fridge and unlocking it again, turning the key and opening the door a dozen different ways, like it was a car with an unreliable starter you needed the right knack to handle.'
p821
aS'The door always opened on that same impossible tunnel.'
p822
aS'We tried shouting down the tunnel, or staying quiet and listening, but our voices were swallowed up and the silence stayed relentless, unbroken except for the quiet hums of the row of tiny lights.'
p823
aS'Later we got braver, tried more drastic measures: Niko had a pocketknife and we took it to the tunnel walls. Underneath the vinyl was more vinyl. We gouged out a chunk eight inches deep before giving up.'
p824
aS'The floor felt like flimsy plastic, bending a little with our weight, but no amount of vigorous stomping shattered or even cracked it.'
p825
aS'"We could get a bunch of food, mount an expedition," I suggested, half-heartedly. _It can\'t go on forever,_ I wanted to say, but couldn\'t bring myself to. He didn\'t answer.\n\nFinally, we gave up.'
p826
aS'We climbed back down the ladder to the empty pool and stepped back into the hall. I was trying to think of next steps, more plans, but my body and mind were exhausted. I turned to pull the pool door shut behind us.'
p827
aS'As I did I noticed a small yellow square was stuck to it.'
p828
aS'"Niko," I gasped, breath failing me, "oh _shit_. There\'s a note. Someone left a note."'
p829
aS'We stared at it, afraid to touch it. We saw immediately that it was the one we\'d left earlier, at the junction with the glints. "NOT THIS WAY," it said in Niko\'s handwriting.'
p830
aS'But the smiley face with the demon eyebrows looked sinister now, malevolent.\n\nThe arrow pointed toward the pool room, and the fridge.'
p831
aS'"It\'s them," Niko breathed, sagging back against the opposite wall, as far away from the note as possible. "Our doubles. They moved it. My god, Ry. They came here and moved it. They were right outside."'
p832
aS'My mind whirled. "Then that means there must be another way through. Some way for them to get here."'
p833
aS'"Maybe." He swallowed, face pale. "Or maybe there\'s something else going on. Something\'s down here with us, man. Fucking with us."\n\nWe stared at the note.'
p834
aS'_NOT THIS WAY._\n\nThe silence was almost painful.'
p835
aS'Abruptly Niko turned and started back down the hall, toward the surface, not talking, not looking back. I was right behind him.'
p836
aS'* * *\n\nWhen I was a kid I got way into swimming one year, another obsession. I started going to the rec center pool every day after school, having mom drop me off there on weekends.'
p837
aS"They had a swim program and I shot through all the rankings. Minnow, Fish, Flying Fish, Salmon, Shark, Tiger Shark. I swam. I don't recall especially enjoying it: it was just something I did, like a job."
p838
aS"Then at school one day someone asked me why I was so into it and I couldn't tell them. I could hold my breath for forever, which helped, but hardly seemed like a good reason."
p839
aS"The truth was I had no idea why I was doing it, and that terrified me. What had made me start? I couldn't remember."
p840
aS'I felt almost violated, possessed, like some outside force had tricked me into driving all my thoughts and energies into moving back and forth through lanes of water, over and over again, for months on end.'
p841
aS"I stopped not long after, in part because I was hitting puberty and changing clothes in front of other guys was becoming more and more mortifying, but I think really it was because I couldn't explain that compulsion and it scared me."
p842
aS'I felt it again, now. I wanted to stay Downstairs. Sure, I could rationalize this away: the only way back home was down here. But the real reason was that I wanted to find out what was down there, more than anything. I was driven to.'
p843
aS"Something was driving me. At least that's how it felt."
p844
aS"I didn't mention any of this to Niko. I knew if I did it might put him off exploring altogether."
p845
aS"We didn't talk much on the way back, and when we climbed up through my bed and shut it, we split up. Niko went out the front door without a word."
p846
aS'I lay on my bed listening to records until I got too creeped out imagining what might be underneath me, and went out to curl up on the porch swing, instead.'
p847
aS'The summer air was hot, with only the hint of a breeze, but felt infinitely better than the cold dead air down there.'
p848
aS'I tried to think of anything else, but something kept dragging my brain Downstairs, as if it was too heavy to stay on the surface with me.'
p849
aS"No matter how often I clawed my way onto other topics, Downstairs and all the things we didn't know about it dominated my thoughts.\n\nI had no idea what we should do next."
p850
aS"When Niko came back it was with a brown bag from the liquor store, and he went straight up to his room, not even looking at me. I should have stopped him but I didn't feel like talking to him either."
p851
aS"We didn't know what was going on; we didn't know how to stop it. We didn't know anything.\n\nWe might have stayed in our funk for another couple days, except something happened the next morning."
p852
aS'The local history lady had left me a voicemail at around 7:15, a solid fantasy movie and credits before I normally woke up.'
p853
aS"She'd been useless when I'd stopped by before,"
p854
aS'and her tone of voice in the message---"something a bit exciting\'s come to light about your house"---made me assume she\'d dredged up some trivia as a pretense to get me to come back and keep her company.'
p855
aS'Maybe get me to join the local history society myself. A warm-blooded young person like myself could even aspire to become treasurer.'
p856
aS'So it was a couple hours before I got around to calling her back and asking when would be a good time to come over.'
p857
aS'"Oh, come right away," she said, voice syrupy. "This really can\'t wait. Just wait till you see what I\'ve found."'
p858
aS"Not at all encouraged, I agreed to head over, and biked the mile or so to her run-down house. The visit got off to an ugly start when she asked why I hadn't brought my colored friend this time."
p859
aS'"Actually, he\'s Greek," I said through clenched teeth, and then wished I had the guts to say something else.'
p860
aS"She served me tea again, weak to the point of tastelessness, and spent so much time making small talk I'd convinced myself she hadn't found anything and this whole exercise was a waste of time."
p861
aS'Worse, she kept glancing at my pride bracelet and pursing her lips, and then pretending not to have done either.'
p862
aS'I wanted to get out of there but was too mentally exhausted to remember how social interactions were supposed to work, what niceties would bring a conversation to an end.'
p863
aS"She was rolling me out with polite nothings and platitudes, like dough, and I couldn't escape it."
p864
aS"The third or fourd time I pressed her about what she'd found, she got up with a triumphant smile and bustled out, returning a minute later with a file folder holding a few photocopies."
p865
aS'"I did some digging on your address," she said, "and found something rather interesting." She pressed up against me as she handed over the file, a bony shoulder and cloying perfume crowding into my personal space.'
p866
aS'Trying not to sneeze, I opened the file and pulled out the first page.'
p867
aS'Clutching the page, I scanned the smudged text. It was a blurry copy of an old newspaper article, maybe from around the turn of the century.'
p868
aS'I didn\'t see the relevance until a few contextual clues started popping out at me ("by the new university"; "on top of the hill") and I realized where the entrance to this cave was. I almost choked on my tea.'
p869
aS'It was about a search for two kids who had gotten lost in an underground cave, dating from a summer in 1931. Two neighborhood boys, 15 and 17, had gone exploring in the caves and never come back out.'
p870
aS'Rescuers sent down had heard faint voices, and it was suspected the pair had been boxed in by rising water. Brave men had tried swimming through flooded passages, but none had been successful at reaching the boys.'
p871
aS'Some rescuers had proposed digging a shaft down to them from the surface, but none could agree where to dig: different rescuers had heard the voices coming from very different places, saying very different things.'
p872
aS'The next article, dated a day later, was a short history of the cave, most likely a filler piece given a lack of new rescue details to report.'
p873
aS'The cave had been a source of trouble before, it seemed: a forbidden but popular spot for local youths, it had never been mapped but was not believed to be extensive.'
p874
aS'But it was treacherous in part because of a spring which bubbled up from its depths with unpredictable rhythms, sometimes flooding lower passages or resmoothing upper ones.'
p875
aS'The spring\'s varying flow erased markers and made it hard to tell the twisting tunnels apart, making the cave seem "far larger than its true extent."'
p876
aS'It had no official name but the locals had given it various nicknames, among the most popular of which was Looking-Glass Cave, after the clear pool the spring waters sometimes left at its entrance.'
p877
aS'The article explained that this was a reference to a Robert Louis Stevenson poem taught in local schools which all the kids knew, and which the article reprinted in its entirety. Some of the verses seemed uncomfortably on-the-nose.'
p878
aS'Sailing blossoms, silver fishes,\n Pave pools as clear as air---\n How a child wishes\n To live down there!'
p879
aS'We can see our coloured faces\n Floating on the shaken pool\n Down in cool places,\n Dim and very cool\n\nI flipped to the other few pages in the folder as the woman twittered on about her sleuthing skills in the county archives.'
p880
aS'The remaining articles painted a grim picture of the subsequent week of rescue attempts, the breathless updates unable to disguise the fact that all had failed.'
p881
aS'Squabbling about the proper dig site, fears of digging too aggressively and causing a cave-in,'
p882
aS'a surge of flooding from the spring which was flowing "with unusual vigor" that season, and ever-growing crowds of spectators all delayed and complicated the rescue efforts.'
p883
aS'The final article was short, the tone terse, only the headline betraying a hint of pathos: CAVE SEARCH CALLED OFF: SURELY NO HOPE LEFT FOR YOUNG SPELUNKERS. It announced that after fifteen days the rescue efforts had been abandoned.'
p884
aS'No voices had been heard from anywhere in days, and the boys were presumed drowned, starved, or buried---dead, one way or another.'
p885
aS'The cave entrance was to be sealed for good, the spring bricked up to prevent its no-longer-pure water from reaching the surface. No future generations of children would stare wistfully into its pools clear as air.'
p886
aS'With the article, for the first time, were pictures of the two boys.'
p887
aS'They stared out from oval windows, sketched in ink, probably sourced from the descriptions of grieving mothers rather than life. They looked younger than their reported ages.'
p888
aS'I stared back at them, unable to stop from wondering what their story had been, what it must have been like to die down there. Alone except for each other. Had they been lifelong friends? Or casual schoolmates exploring the cave on a whim?'
p889
aS'Did their final days bring them closer together, or tear them apart?'
p890
aS'The old woman caught me looking and smiled knowingly. "Been hearing their voices, have you?"\n\n"I\'m sorry?"'
p891
aS'"Lost souls," she said, "haunted. Not right to brick up a stream where a thing like that\'s happened. Keep that trauma bottled up."'
p892
aS'"I don\'t think that\'s it," I said, annoyed. I didn\'t believe in ghosts and hadn\'t heard any teenage voices sobbing in the night. "By that logic, any river anywhere should be haunted.'
p893
aS'I mean, twenty thousand people died building the Panama Canal, and you don\'t hear about---"\n\n"The ringleader was probably the Mexican one," she interrupted, tapping one of the pencils with a portrait.'
p894
aS'It took me a full five seconds to recover from this cognitive shift. "Uh, what?"'
p895
aS'"Maybe looking for a good place to hide," she said, matter-of-fact, still tapping the portrait. I looked down stupidly: one of the boys, I supposed, did have darker skin than the other.'
p896
aS'"Lots of deportations back then, during the Depression. The Spanish boy must have talked the other one into doing something foolish. Pity. Probably didn\'t have much education, didn\'t realize how dangerous those caves were."'
p897
aS'She grinned and her mouth was full of rotting teeth. "Of course, they are very good at swimming rivers."'
p898
aS'Hot anger kindled somewhere inside me, overcoming my usual shyness. "That\'s a shitty thing to say about two dead boys."'
p899
aS'She puckered her mouth, glanced again at my pride bracelet. "Well. Should have realized you\'d be the _sensitive_ type."'
p900
aS"I couldn't take this any more. Her racist bullshit aside, the notion that what was happening to me was a cute ghost story for her to solve was so disconnected from the growing existential dread of the past few days I wanted to slap her."
p901
aS"I tried to remember she'd done me a favor, but in that moment I couldn't stand her."
p902
aS"She was everyone who thought my problems had simple explanations, everything wrong with a world that was broken and couldn't be bothered to care about fixing itself. For a moment, brief and burning, I hated her."
p903
aS"And that's when her face came unstuck."
p904
aS'This was back when movies were still celluloid, and at the dollar theater by our house the film would sometimes jump the gate, get misaligned.'
p905
aS'When that happened the image would smear, frames no longer projected neat one after the other but running liquid through the machine, all movement turned into vertical bands of distorted color;'
p906
aS'and the audio would go juddery, vague, and distant, recognizable but distorted.'
p907
aS'Clipped and monstrous.\n\nThis was like that but in three dimensions.'
p908
aS'The woman exploded. Her face twisted and smeared, exposing blood and bone.'
p909
aS'The back of her tongue flapped against her pulsing epiglottis, her eyes round spheres peeling back, turning inside out, her lips deformed and pulled like taffy into a twisting shape that reached from the ceiling to her knees.'
p910
aS'Her fingers had gone long as tree branches and skinny like pencils, twisting and jerking backward at frantic angles; the pattern of her dress had multiplied and filled the empty spaces in the air and was so thick now I choked on it.'
p911
aS'Everything moved, everything in her sounded, and the sound was a scream, like her lungs were jet engines, her voice box a bleating thing the size of a cow being flayed alive.'
p912
aS'I dropped the teacup and the files: I vaguely remember them tumbling toward the floor in slow motion, spilling and twisting around each other. I was screaming too. All I wanted was to get away.'
p913
aS"I stumbled back and my head cracked against a cabinet of china plates; I held up my hands to shield myself, as if such a pathetic act could matter against a thing so huge and horrible. It came toward me, moving fast. I couldn't stop it."
p914
aS'My sanity frayed.'
p915
aS'And then she snapped back into herself, and her voice returned to normal. Almost. It still juddered, like the floor beneath her vibrated a hundred times a second.'
p916
aS'And her skin was boiling and rippling, like something inside it was desperate to get out. Thousands of tiny somethings pushing and pounding with disproportionate strength against her wrinkled flesh.'
p917
aS'She reached toward me---and maybe this was all in my head, maybe she was trying to help, reacting in shock to my reaction,'
p918
aS'what must have seemed like some kind of seizure---but as she opened her mouth to speak, the rippling distortions made it into a grin.'
p919
aS'A huge, horrible, ravenous grin, malevolent. Gleeful.\n\nHer reaching fingers writhed, and her eyes were wide and round as saucers.'
p920
aS'I jerked to my feet and ran.'
p921
aS"For a while I didn't even know what direction I was running. I bolted straight through intersections and past oblivious pedestrians, not seeing them. I wasn't thinking about anything at all."
p922
aS"I didn't stop until a knife in my side brought me up short, bent me double, and I realized I'd been running a long time."
p923
aS'I collapsed on a patch of hot grass and threw up, retching and gasping. Gnats scribbled the air around me. Somewhere a dog barked.'
p924
aS'I stayed there five or ten minutes, breathing jagged, looking down, studying my hands on the grass and my puke,'
p925
aS'dealing with those three things, the hands and the grass and the puke, not wanting or able to look up or deal with anything else.'
p926
aS'Nothing happened. After a while that started to help.'
p927
aS'Eventually I climbed to my feet, got my bearings. I realized I knew where I was. I walked slowly back to our house.'
p928
aS'I never went back for my bike.'
p929
aS'* * *\n\nWhen I got home, Niko was gone. I let myself into his bedroom and curled up on his bed, because I needed to be surrounded by something familiar. The smell of him was an anchor to reality. Maybe the only one.'
p930
aS"I came in here sometimes when he was gone, usually only when he left the door unlocked. I didn't touch anything."
p931
aS'I just wanted to see the pieces of his life in isolation from his too-bright self, read the story they told about him with no silhouette from that burning corona.'
p932
aS"Once I'd seen a brochure from the campus LGBT center in his trash can, and wondered about that for a long time: why he'd taken it, why he'd thrown it away."
p933
aS'I must have drifted off, because moments later the afternoon light was dying and his hand was on my shoulder, shaking it. I jerked awake, guilty excuses on my lips. He was screaming at me.'
p934
aS'"What the _fuck_ are you doing in here?" His face twisted with a rage I\'d never seen there, sharp and ragged.'
p935
aS'"I didn\'t... I just..." I staggered to my feet, not knowing what to say.'
p936
aS'"Get the fuck out," he shouted, and then I saw something behind the rage: a fear, a wild, desperate fear. There were tears in his eyes.'
p937
aS'"Get out, out of my fucking room, I just want to be _alone_," he yelled, and as I backed up stammering he shoved me,'
p938
aS'so hard I slammed into the wall, cracking my head, and then he dropped down on his haunches and buried his face in his hands and started to sob.'
p939
aS"I would have left except I'd only heard him sob like that once before, and I couldn't stand the thought of letting him do it alone."
p940
aS'"What happened?" I finally asked, back still pressed to the wall, afraid to move in any direction, towards him or away.'
p941
aS'He ran his hands through his hair, staying crouched, staring at the floor. "Something\'s... following me," he said at last, quiet, miserable. "Shadows. Something\'s wrong with the shadows."'
p942
aS'He looked up and past me, haunted, like speaking to someone behind my shoulder. "There\'s too many of them. I can see them squirming out of the corner of my eye. Like they can\'t all fit in the shade they\'ve been given.'
p943
aS"They're following me, wherever I move, like regular shadows except these ones are alive and thinking about me and looking at me and _hungry_ for me,"
p944
aS'and every time I turn around there\'s more of them pressing into the same space, packed tight, squeezing in, wriggling, more of them each time, more and more and more and more and more..."'
p945
aS'I knelt down,\ngrabbed his shoulders and shook him, then did it again, hard. His head flopped back and he grabbed my wrist, a faint annoyance reaching his face. I was glad to see anything there at all.'
p946
aS'I let him focus on me before saying, "There\'s no shadows."\n\nHe stared at me.'
p947
aS'I shook my head, more sure of it now. "It\'s not ghosts, or a thing out there, stalking us. It _is_ us. We\'re what\'s wrong here. We\'re the ones who don\'t belong." I swallowed, bile still souring the back of my throat. "We\'re slipping.'
p948
aS'Losing our grip on... something. This whole world, maybe. Or it\'s losing its grip on us."\n\nI had his full attention now.'
p949
aS'"And I don\'t know what happens when we let go, or it does," I finished. "But I don\'t think it\'s good."'
p950
aS'He stared at me, hopeless. "There\'s no way back."'
p951
aS'"There is. There has to be." I took a breath. "We just have to find it."'
p952
aS"Chapter 7\n\nWe turned the wall of his bedroom into a map, taping up big sheets of artist's paper, shoving piles of books and unwashed dishes and dirty socks and two scuffed snowboards out of the way to make room."
p953
aS'He transferred our notebook sketches to the wall and we tried to fill in the rest from memory.'
p954
aS"It was imperfect, because stairs down there ran up and down and the wall was flat, and also because the hallways twisted at weird angles and we didn't have surveying equipment to sort them out. But it was a start."
p955
aS"It was also painfully incomplete. There were dozens of doors we'd never tried, branches and halls we'd only glanced into."
p956
aS"Almost everything we had seen was from that single hall off the big room, the one we'd tried on a whim our first time down. Other than peering around the first couple corners, we hadn't explored the other four halls at all."
p957
aS'Niko swept a hand across all the empty space. "We\'re fucked."'
p958
aS'"Look," I countered, "we know the other versions of us found a key, somewhere. And we also know the two sides are staying almost exactly in sync. Close enough to spill coffee the same way."'
p959
aS'"Not close enough to leave each others\' fucking sticky notes alone."'
p960
aS'"Still," I pressed on, "that means the keys can\'t have been too well-hidden. We could have almost found one, walked right past it. Maybe the only difference was a momentary decision about which door to go through, what wall to glance at."'
p961
aS'"Doesn\'t matter." He stirred his coffee, morose, and sat it down to cool on his dresser, next to a half-empty older mug growing a skim of mold. "The keys are useless now, anyway."'
p962
aS'"If there\'s one set of keys, there might be more. Other keys, other doors. And besides, we have no idea what else might be down there. We need to keep looking."'
p963
aS"He ran a hand through his hair, a familiar gesture, but he looked changed. His eyes were getting sunken, from lack of sleep or some more worrisome deficiency. His face, so often laughing, hadn't smiled in days."
p964
aS'"Synchronicity," he said. "That\'s the problem."\n\n"How do you mean?"'
p965
aS'"I think we\'re getting out of sync with them. Day by day, decision by decision, we\'re losing our lockstep. And the farther out of sync we drift, the harder it gets to go back."\n\n"Speculation."'
p966
aS'"And the deeper," he pressed on, "the deeper we\'ll have to go to find another way through."'
p967
aS'"Bullshit." But I didn\'t have energy to argue with him. Clearly we couldn\'t solve anything from up here. We needed to go back down. We had to fill in the blank spaces on that map.'
p968
aS'Our first expedition departed the next morning. We had backpacks, trail mix and energy bars, lots of flashlights and batteries, twine, spray paint, a compass, graph paper, whistles, and rope.'
p969
aS"Despite everything, I think the prep got us fired up a bit. If answers were down there, we'd find them. We skipped class and I called in sick to work, and we both agreed if necessary we'd do the same tomorrow, and the next day."
p970
aS'Finding a way back was top priority.'
p971
aS'"They\'re not _our_ grades anyway," Niko said with a smirk. I sensed a slippery slope here vis-\xc3\xa0-vis morality and nihilism, but I wasn\'t in the mood to debate philosophy with him. I wanted to move. To delve. Find some answers.'
p972
aS"We chose one of the unexplored halls off the big room, and decided to explore as much of it as we could, until we'd mapped it all or got too tired to keep going. We picked the one at the far end of the room, opposite the stairs back up."
p973
aS'Right away we found something different.'
p974
aS'The first few twists and turns were like the rest of the top level: carpet, wall sconces, scuffed doors.'
p975
aS'But after a short and confusing snarl of hallways and tiny rooms, the floorplan opened up into an area with brighter lights in the sconces, and longer, straighter hallways.\n\nExcept some of them went straight down.'
p976
aS'We stood at the lip of one of these pits and stared over the edge. It was like someone had taken a regular hallway and stood it on end.'
p977
aS'The brown carpet went right over the lip and continued straight down, passing sideways doors, sideways wall sconces.'
p978
aS'Maybe seventy or eighty feet down, it hit a carpeted bottom and leveled out again, branching in opposite horizontal directions.'
p979
aS"The pit filled the exact center of a junction; we could step around the corners into hallways leading off in the three other directions from the one we'd arrived. It was a five-way intersection, all at right-angles."
p980
aS'A couple dozen paces down one of those halls was another pit.\n\n"What is this," Niko sighed, "challenge mode?"'
p981
aS"When you think of treacherous terrain a basement hallway isn't the first thing that comes to mind, but clutching the corner and peering vertiginously down, the pit looked as unscalable as the Matterhorn."
p982
aS"There was nothing to get a grip on, except the doorways every twenty feet or so. Clearly we couldn't get down without climbing gear, nor come back up without it either.\n\nIf you fell... if you got stuck down there..."
p983
aS'We stepped carefully around the pit and kept exploring on the same level. But the pits were everywhere. Each horizontal hall would dead end sooner or later, and the side rooms were all small and empty.'
p984
aS"Some of them had hallway pits, too, leading down from their exact center. After an hour we'd mapped out everything we could get to without a climbing harness."
p985
aS'Other than going back to the big room, there was no way forward except fourteen pits, each at least fifty feet deep.'
p986
aS'"Difficult could be good." He perked up. "This is the first thing we\'ve had to work for. Maybe means there\'s something interesting down there."'
p987
aS'"Or maybe one of the other hallways leads to a room filled floor to ceiling with keys. No point guessing."'
p988
aS"We went back to explore one of the other halls---we didn't have much choice---and found something different there, too. About half the doors led not to rooms, but to crawlways."
p989
aS'They were those half-sized doors you find sometimes that open onto water heaters or the electric meter in your house.'
p990
aS'Flush with the floor and about three-and-a-half feet tall, they opened onto similarly miniaturized corridors, snaking off in two directions for a dozen feet with T-junctions at each end.'
p991
aS'Niko leaned casually against the door and poked his head inside with a suave expression. "Hey," he said to the crawlway, "How _you_ doin\'?"\n\nWe figured out pretty quick it was a maze.'
p992
aS'You could stoop-walk, but crawling on all fours was a lot more comfortable. (For me, at least. Niko kept bumping his head and swearing.) The tiny hallways branched and split constantly, keeping to neat ninety-degree angles.'
p993
aS'Those ever-present wall sconces remained brightly lit, but the crawlway never went the same direction for long. Doors were scarce, and they all led back to normal-sized halls.'
p994
aS'Once we realized how easy it would be to get lost, we retraced our steps and sat panting by the entrance.'
p995
aS'"Promising," Niko said. "They\'re making us work for it."'
p996
aS'"There\'s no \'they,\'" I said automatically, mostly because I didn\'t want to think about it. "And it\'s the same problem again. We can\'t risk getting lost down here."'
p997
aS'"But this is easier, man. We don\'t need specialized equipment. Just some way to leave a path. Hansel and Gretel, like you said."'
p998
aS"Or maybe Ariadne. I had a ball of twine in my pack, so we settled for a simple solution: tying one end to my ankle, and the other around the half-door's knob."
p999
aS'After some deliberation, we decided to keep our packs on, despite the awkwardness of crawling the tunnels with them. Having girded ourselves with stuff, we felt naked without it now.'
p1000
aS"We set off to map. It wasn't long before we found another, even tinier door."
p1001
aS'This one was no more than eighteen inches high. Peering inside it, we saw an even smaller crawlway, with even smaller doors running up and down its length.\n\n"That\'s some Alice in Wonderland shit right there," Niko muttered.'
p1002
aS"We could maybe have squeezed into the next level of smaller crawlways without our packs, but there didn't seem to be much point. Maybe the crawlways could get fractally smaller, but we couldn't."
p1003
aS'We decided to stick to the first tier of crawlways and map out their extent.\n\nWhat happened next caught us completely unprepared.'
p1004
aS"We'd started crawling in a promising direction. I'd begun to feel almost cheerful: we were solving the mystery, peeling back this place's secrets. Surely it was just a matter of time before we found a way back home."
p1005
aS'Something _yanked_ my ankle from behind.'
p1006
aS'I gasped and twisted around. The twine tied to my ankle was taut, and pulling me with terrible force, starting to drag me back the crawlway. I cried out, digging my fingers into the carpet.'
p1007
aS'The twine scraping against the edge of the junction behind us sounded coarse and ugly, like a rusty knife dragged over the hairy skin of a coconut.'
p1008
aS'"What the fuck, _help me!_" I shouted. The loop around my ankle was viciously tight, cutting off circulation. My fingers scrabbled for purchase but the carpet wasn\'t shaggy enough to grip.'
p1009
aS'Niko scrambled back towards me, shrugging out of his pack and grabbing my arm. But as he pulled me back the twine dug into my ankle like a vise, like the pressure would saw the line straight through my foot. It _hurt_.'
p1010
aS'I couldn\'t understand why it hadn\'t snapped. "Cut it, fucking cut it!" I gasped.'
p1011
aS'He cursed and let me go, whipping back around to zipper open his pack, letting the line start to drag me away. The sound of the twine scraping the corner seemed way too loud, like someone was holding a mike against it.'
p1012
aS'I reached up to grab a wall sconce and the cheap thing twisted off in my hand, sparking as the bulb went out. I held onto it stupidly as the line around my ankle dragged us both away, reeling out drywall-dusted power cable from the wall.'
p1013
aS'I panicked. My mind flashed through visions of monsters waiting just around the corner, reeling me in. A horned demon. Some evil-eyed little girl from a shitty horror movie.'
p1014
aS'And then the history lady flashed into my head, inside-out and distorted past the breaking point, eyes white and wide;'
p1015
aS'and I jabbed my fingers into the grooves in the fake wooden wall paneling and started babbling\n\n SURELY NO HOPE LEFT\n\nmind slipping towards the only place it might be safe\n\n How a child wishes\n To live down there!'
p1016
aS'and Niko cut the twine.'
p1017
aS"I missed the lead-up in my nightmare, but he'd dug through his pack for the Swiss army knife, lost at the bottom with the camping gear, then struggled to squeeze ahead of me without kicking me in the face."
p1018
aS"He told me later he'd barely touched the blade to the twine when the taut line snapped, whipping around the corner in a fraction of a second."
p1019
aS'He had to spend a minute calming me down. My mind had skidded toward some rarely glimpsed drop-off, pulled edgeward by a dark and primal gravity, and it took time to climb handhold by handhold back up to the light.'
p1020
aS'What brought me back, prosaically enough, was the growing unpleasant tingling in my foot. Pins and needles: painful, but familiar.'
p1021
aS'The knot on the twine had slipped down and pulled a tight loop around my leg just above the ankle, digging half an inch into my jeans. Niko helped me cut it off and I sat rubbing my foot for a long time, calming down, waiting.\n\nListening.'
p1022
aS'After maybe fifteen minutes we started back, Niko up front with the knife. I was equally terrified bringing up the rear, though, constantly looking over my shoulder, miserable and afraid.'
p1023
aS'The fact that the lighting was so bright and consistent, so cheery, only tinged my fear a more metallic shade.'
p1024
aS"Around the corner we found the cut end of the twine, slack and unmoving. We followed it all the way back to where we'd come in."
p1025
aS"It was no longer tied to the doorknob, like we'd left it. The twine lay coiled up in a neat loop. Right outside the threshold."
p1026
aS'Chapter 8\n\n"So this is huge," Niko was saying. We were in the funny-shaped room behind the closet with the never-to-be-completed board game, dust gathering on unresolved plans for world domination.'
p1027
aS"We'd moved all our expedition gear in here; we didn't want to explain things to anyone else, and the rest of the housemates had forgotten this room even existed."
p1028
aS'I rubbed the ugly bruise ringing my ankle, sitting on the grimy hardwood floor with my pant leg rolled up.'
p1029
aS'"Oh yeah?" I winced, prodding a tender spot.'
p1030
aS'"It\'s the first concrete sign there\'s something down there. Not glints of light. Not sounds. Something physical."\n\n"Yeah, reassuring."'
p1031
aS'He conceded the point, slumping down next to me. "But why now? What brought this on? Is the maze forbidden? Did we violate some kind of policy?"\n\n"Marking our way."'
p1032
aS'"What?"'
p1033
aS'I sniffled. "It\'s the first time we\'ve tried to leave a permanent trail, something unambiguously marking the way back. Maybe whatever it is... ugh." It still felt awful to verbalize it, give it that kind of legitimacy.'
p1034
aS'"Maybe it didn\'t like that."'
p1035
aS'"Or maybe whatever\'s down there doesn\'t want us exploring the crawlways. Because they lead to something. Something big."'
p1036
aS'I punched the wall, suddenly angry. "Who knows? None of it makes any sense anyway."'
p1037
aS'"That\'ll go on our tombstones. A week from now, when we\'re dead of fucking dimension poisoning."'
p1038
aS'"Well hey, dude, it\'s either that or lung cancer thirty years from now." I mimed taking a drag off a smoke. "At least dimension poisoning\'s probably quicker."'
p1039
aS"He laughed despite himself, and I chalked up a mental win. Cheering him up, making him smile, was so ingrained in me I barely noticed I was doing it any more. Maybe that day, I shouldn't have been."
p1040
aS"It wasn't exactly a situation to be cheerful about."
p1041
aS'_Do I do it because I really want him to be happy? Or is it that I can\'t stand it when he\'s sad?_\n\n"I\'m not going down there again," he said with grim finality.'
p1042
aS'Neither of us said anything for a long minute.'
p1043
aS'"Okay fine, I am. You\'re right. You win. We find a way back. Somehow."\n\n"There\'s monsters up here, too," I said softly.'
p1044
aS'He sniffed. "Or maybe we\'re the monsters, man. Crawled out from underneath the bed."'
p1045
aS"* * *\n\nWe decided to explore the vertical shafts, instead of going back into the crawlways. We didn't know whether what had happened was a message or a provocation. I thought the bruises on my ankle were message enough: Keep Out."
p1046
aS"Niko argued that was exactly why we should ignore it. Wherever they don't want you to go is probably the most interesting place to be. On the other hand, maybe the message had been like fences around Chernobyl."
p1047
aS'Maybe what was farther in was worse.'
p1048
aS"So we settled on the shafts, which were unusual and promising terrain without even mild signs of demonic infestation. One of Niko's ex-hobbies was rock climbing, but he'd stopped after the accident jacked up his wrists."
p1049
aS"Bits of gear still lingered around his overstuffed bedroom, though, so we'd assembled some rope, harnesses, carabiners, and a couple of grappling hooks from the sporting goods store."
p1050
aS'The box called them "Grip Monkeys," which seemed incongruously cheerful.'
p1051
aS"We picked the first pit, since they all seemed about the same, and set about securing the grapples in a doorjamb in a way that would hold our weight. We'd each go down on our own rope, one at a time and using the second as backup."
p1052
aS'We also had extra Grip Monkeys in our pack, in case something happened to these.'
p1053
aS'Along with the usual gear, we also brought down a camcorder. We were too broke to afford the newer all-digital cameras, so we borrowed one that shot on Hi-8 tape.'
p1054
aS"This was before the whole found footage craze, so we didn't think to take the camera down the pit with us and record weepy confessionals into it: we were going to leave it down the hall from the shaft,"
p1055
aS'trained on the pit and our ropes and the Grip Monkeys, hopefully capturing anything that tried to mess with us.'
p1056
aS"When we were ready, and since we didn't have a tripod, I left the camera on the floor a dozen paces back, pointed at the pit, and hit record. We shouldered our packs and Niko tied on to the rope."
p1057
aS'Moving carefully, he stepped over the lip, and started to rappel down the carpeted "floor" of the shaft. I watched his grapple nervously, but it held his weight, tines set deep into the solid wood of the door frame.'
p1058
aS'The bottom of the shaft seemed a mile down with Niko dangling above it, but probably only dropped about seventy feet. He moved fast and soon was stepping onto the once-again-horizontal carpet at the bottom.'
p1059
aS'He shined his light back up at me and gave the all-clear.'
p1060
aS"I followed him down, trying to think only in particulars about what was happening and not the terrifying big picture. I focused on old climbing lessons, what my hands were doing. One thing at a time. Presently I'd made it down too."
p1061
aS'The hall at the bottom of the pit stretched off to either side, like we were at the junction of an upside-down T. Detaching from our dangling ropes, we picked a direction and began to explore.\n\nThings got weird down there.'
p1062
aS"The hallways continued on as they had above, and there were more pits. But these didn't go straight down. Not quite. They descended at angles ranging from severe to subtle, never quite true to vertical. Some were almost ramps."
p1063
aS"Others changed their angle or gradually twisted as they dropped. And while the pit we'd rappelled down was lit, none of these were. They each plunged down into darkness."
p1064
aS'And there were more of them. A lot more. Hundreds. Most opened from the middle of a hallway, filling its width: easy to jump across, but wearing a pack you felt clumsy, were acutely aware you were one stumble away from a very bad time.'
p1065
aS'We decided to avoid any unnecessary leaps, but the pits were so thick they hedged us in, pushed us inexorably towards an unknown destination.'
p1066
aS"If we tried to veer too far off course, they'd get denser, and we'd have to backtrack or turn aside, angling back to our former heading. And the longer we followed it, the more the hallway angles edged off true."
p1067
aS"It was subtle at first. But the horizontal hallways were getting less and less level. We'd stumble on a floor that canted slightly left, or tilted half a degree up or down."
p1068
aS'The walls, too, were growing angled, some leaning outward a degree or two instead of staying neatly parallel, or bent a little bit inward at mismatched angles. It made us feel drunk.'
p1069
aS"You've seen so many well-constructed hallways in your life, your brain doesn't know how to process ones that don't behave.\n\nWe kept going."
p1070
aS'The halls branched and spread out endlessly. We gave up trying to map, other than our route back. We passed through regions of dark and regions of light. The decor rarely varied from its ubiquitous blandness.'
p1071
aS'Sometimes little things were wrong. A door, off its hinges, lying neat and flat in the center of the hall. A light fixture sticking out of the carpet. Crown molding running in a line a foot above the carpet.'
p1072
aS'We searched around these anomalies, but never found anything useful.'
p1073
aS'Some of the rooms got larger, too big for rooms in a house. More like a school gymnasium. Still the same carpet, though. And it felt like we were seeing more of the anomalies, the farther in and deeper down we got.'
p1074
aS'Doors or sections of hallway paved in bathroom tile; weird cube-shaped extrusions or cavities in the edges of rooms. It was like the deeper we went, the more flexible the rules became---of architecture, of stability, of god knows what else.'
p1075
aS'We were getting tired. Just before turning back, though, we found one last curious room. We could hear it before we opened the door.'
p1076
aS'The room was the size of a squash court, though not quite as tall, the whole thing covered in green bathroom tile, even the inside of the door we came through. A sink rose serenely from its center.'
p1077
aS'Scalding water blasted from the faucet, releasing clouds of billowing steam and filling the air with a moist, sticky warmth.'
p1078
aS'The sink was full, water spilling over its sides and flowing down the porcelain like some artsy fountain, then streaming away across the tile, presumably according to some imperceptible tilt in the floor.'
p1079
aS'It vanished down an open hallway, carpeted once again, slanting down at a steep angle from a corner of the room.'
p1080
aS'We walked over to the hallway to peer down. It was closer to vertical than horizontal, dropping at a vicious angle.'
p1081
aS'Where the hot stream hit the tilted carpet it became black with mold, and the walls and ceiling of the tunnel were stained with rust and moss. Like water had been coursing through it for a long, long time.'
p1082
aS'From the slanting darkness rose a hot smell of rot.\n\n"This feels different," Niko said.'
p1083
aS'We walked back to the sink and tried to turn off the faucet, but the hot and cold knobs spun loose. The scalding water rushed full force out of the tap, churning noisily in the basin.'
p1084
aS'"We\'re going to have a hell of a water bill," I joked, but then remembered something. The newspaper article from the history lady, about the boys lost in the cave whose entrance had once been on the site of our house.'
p1085
aS'The spring that bubbled up from beneath it. The spring that had been bricked up.\n\nLooking-Glass Cave.'
p1086
aS"I felt as if something was on the verge of snapping into place, making sense. But I couldn't quite see it."
p1087
aS'We can see our coloured faces\n Floating on the shaken pool\n\nI got down on hands and knees to stare into the running water, not sure what I expected to see. But there was nothing.'
p1088
aS"The billowing steam and rippling of the water meant I couldn't even see my own reflection.\n\nI got to my feet, feeling deflated."
p1089
aS'Niko was beaming his flashlight down the tunnel, chasing the descending path of the stream. "This would be rough going. Steep and slick. We\'d need better climbing gear. And I can\'t see how far down it goes."'
p1090
aS'I took a deep breath. "It feels like that\'s the way, though. Doesn\'t it?"'
p1091
aS'He ran a hand through steam-wilted hair, eyes still pulled down the shaft. "Jesus, I hope not."'
p1092
aS"* * *\n\nI couldn't stop thinking about the wet tunnel as we retracted our steps. Images of it flashed through my mind. The thought of what might be past the reach of our flashlight beams, what was down there, was maddening."
p1093
aS"I was planning how soon we could come back down, what we'd have to bring with us. What it would take to keep pushing deeper."
p1094
aS"We passed through the last few hallways to the base of shaft we'd come down. On the carpet directly underneath were our ropes, coiled up neat, Grip Monkeys still tied to the end."
p1095
aS'"God damn it," Niko said with feeling, craning his head to glare accusingly at the shaft and fling curses up its length. We couldn\'t see anything unusual up there, not from down here.\n\nOur way back up had been cut off.'
p1096
aS"We had extra grapples in our packs, but the originals didn't seem damaged: just detached. The shaft was too narrow to throw one all the way back up without hitting a wall, so we settled for hooking a doorway, halfway up."
p1097
aS"Our position now was much more precarious. We couldn't tell if the grapple was set properly: we just had to trust it. Niko volunteered to go first. From the ground below, I watched him climb, anxious."
p1098
aS"And for some reason, that was the moment I finally accepted that I was still in love with him. I'd tried so hard to convince myself I wasn't, that I'd moved on, wrung him out of my heart, that all we had was an especially deep friendship."
p1099
aS"But watching him dangle from that rope, knowing he could fall at any second, I couldn't pretend any more. I'd never stopped loving him. I didn't know how. Maybe I never would."
p1100
aS'And that was also the moment the grappling hook ripped through the molding of the wooden doorframe far above, and Niko fell.'
p1101
aS'Chapter 9\n\nTime seemed to snap and twist back on itself in opposing directions, both too fast and too slow.'
p1102
aS"Terror struck me like lightning, searing me with unbearable matching thoughts: _he's going to die_ and _there's nothing I can do to help him_."
p1103
aS'Then he grabbed the edge of the next doorframe down and his body slammed against the horizontal door beneath. I watched the bottoms of his sneakers as they kicked and flailed at the smooth beige wall, scrabbling for purchase.'
p1104
aS'He was still too far up. _Too far._ If he fell...'
p1105
aS'"Are you okay?" I shouted up at him, or something equally useless. My lungs were clenched so tight that for a minute I couldn\'t breathe back in.'
p1106
aS"He'd managed to press the toes of his sneakers up against the wall, but there was nothing to stand on. His position was desperate, hands gripping the inch of molding like claws. I could see muscles trembling even from here."
p1107
aS'He clung to the wall quivering like a caught-out insect, paralyzed with indecision.'
p1108
aS'"You\'re okay." I tried to keep my voice light, in control, willing confidence into it and up to him. My mind thrummed as it raced to find him a way out.'
p1109
aS'He was still clipped on to the climbing rope but the grapple now swayed useless beneath him.'
p1110
aS'The hallway pit ran featureless above and below the doorframe he clung to: there was nothing else to get a grip on, not for a dozen feet in either direction.'
p1111
aS'"The door." I projected calm authority. "You need to get the door open. If there\'s a room inside, it\'ll only be a little drop. Niko. Are you listening to me?"'
p1112
aS'He shook his head, as if snapping out of shock, found the doorknob beneath him and focused on it. It was on the bottom side of the door from our perspective, at waist-height for Niko, but too far off to the side to easily reach.'
p1113
aS'He lifted an ineffectual foot to try kicking at it, but it was too high. I watched his fingers slip towards the edge of the molding.'
p1114
aS'"Nice idea." I tried to keep my voice steady. "Just try again, okay? I\'m right here. If you fall, I\'ve got you." But did I, really? My arms were stretched out stupidly, but if he fell into them from that height it would break us both.'
p1115
aS"He kicked again, more desperate this time, foot still far from the knob. His shoe scudded across the smooth paint of the door. His fingers gripped the molding so tight they'd gone white. He couldn't hold a grip like that much longer."
p1116
aS'"You almost had it," I lied. "Come on, buddy, you got this."'
p1117
aS'"Just shut up for a second," he shouted, flashing a glare down at me. "Stop fucking telling me what you think I want to hear and shut up."'
p1118
aS"I fell silent, face flushed, paralyzed. Singed.\n\nHe stared at the knob, and the silence sharpened until I couldn't help but break it, to say out lout what I knew he was thinking."
p1119
aS'"You\'ll have to let go with one hand." I said it as even as I could. "Just for a second. To turn the knob." I breathed. "There\'s no other way."'
p1120
aS'He nodded. I stood helpless below him, arms still stretched up, aching.\n\nThen he did it.'
p1121
aS'In one quick move he pressed his body in toward the door, letting his toes take as much weight as they could, let go of the frame with his left hand and thrust it out hard toward the knob.'
p1122
aS"He brushed it and for a horrible moment it looked like he wouldn't be able to grip it and turn it, the angle all wrong, and so was his balance, now; but then his fingers wrapped around the knob, his wrist twisted and it turned."
p1123
aS'The door clunked and swung inwards from the bottom as his weight pushed against it, and he half-collapsed, half-scrambled through as his balance was lost, fingers slipping off the frame.'
p1124
aS'He tumbled inside, banging knees and shins, and fell through, the door swinging shut behind him like a cat flap, muffled thumps and curses making their way through the walls.'
p1125
aS'But before I could even breathe out, a shock of awful, sawtoothed sound smacked into me from above, and I was so startled I bit my tongue.'
p1126
aS'It was utterly alien, a juddering metallic _twang_ that lingered in the air, throbbing, jittery, reluctant to die away.\n\nAnd then I realized what it was.'
p1127
aS'The sound turned in an instant from monstrous to mundane. Niko must have thwacked it as he tumbled past, flailing: one of those springy metal doorstoppers, no doubt surprised to meet a falling body instead of a hastily opened door.'
p1128
aS'* * *\n\nWe made it to the top, in the end.'
p1129
aS'It took a series of shorter climbs to each sideways room, treating them like miniature base camps, places to rest before flinging the grapple up another dozen feet to the next door, the next cube of safety;'
p1130
aS'testing each set of the grapple more thoroughly, belaying each other as best we could in the patently unsafe circumstances.'
p1131
aS"But at length, we'd made it back out."
p1132
aS'"Sorry about earlier. What I said." I\'d just grabbed his hand pulling me up the last few feet, and now we were sprawled on the carpet, mercifully horizontal again, like two mountaineers on the world\'s blandest summit.'
p1133
aS'"Don\'t worry about it. You just... do that sometimes, and it bugs me." _Tell him what I think he wants to hear._ I shut my eyes. "I wish you\'d..." He lifted a hand, gestured vaguely in the air, dropped it in defeat. "Whatever, forget it.'
p1134
aS'There\'s a million more important things to worry about."\n\nThe camcorder was where we\'d left it, sitting on the carpet pointed at the pit.'
p1135
aS"The door frame where our original grapples had been attached wasn't damaged. We'd seated them pretty firmly, so this suggested that rather than being yanked free from below, someone had carefully unhooked them from up here."
p1136
aS'Of course, the ropes had also been neatly coiled at the bottom. Someone had to have done that from down there.'
p1137
aS"Niko didn't want to watch the tape, not while we were still Downstairs. But I couldn't stand not knowing. So he huddled miserably beside me while we watched the footage on the tiny flip-out screen."
p1138
aS'The tape had run to the end, so we backed it up a bit and hit play. To our dismay, the ropes were going over the edge right to the end; whatever happened, it had been after the tape ran out.'
p1139
aS'Niko held down the rewind button and we settled in for a long haul: but after only a few seconds we saw ourselves spring back up from the pit in fast motion, first me and then him;'
p1140
aS'dicker with the grapples and rope for a few minutes; then zip over to the camera to turn it on.'
p1141
aS'"I swear the tape was at the beginning," Niko said. "There should have been two hours of space. This is like five minutes at most. What the hell?"'
p1142
aS'He let go of the rewind button and let the tape play.'
p1143
aS"We watched in numb frustration as everything we'd done earlier played back: the same discussions about rope and seating the grapples, the same lame jokes failing to ease tension. There wasn't much point to watching it all unfold again."
p1144
aS"We just didn't know what else to do."
p1145
aS'On the tiny screen, I was standing a pace or two back, wondering aloud how much stuff we should take down with us. I hated how my voice sounded on tape, how my face looked. I always had. Even on the tiny screen I could see red blotches.'
p1146
aS'On the screen a miniature Niko sat on the edge of the pit, adjusting his ropes.\n\nDistorted by the shitty camcorder speaker, he said, "How far down do you think this goes?"'
p1147
aS'My image shrugged, said "We could possibly go much deeper."'
p1148
aS'My skin crawled. "Oh my god."'
p1149
aS'Niko glanced at me. "What?"'
p1150
aS'"That\'s not what I said." My head was spinning. What _had_ I said? Something like _It can\'t possibly go much deeper_, maybe. Not that.'
p1151
aS'Screen-Niko said "You\'re right. Actually, we shouldn\'t you and I come back this route at all. We should go deeper and we should let\'s stay down, down and deep." His voice sounded strained, but he pulled his rope tight smartly.'
p1152
aS'"Don\'t come back up until we find it, Ry. What it is we need to find."'
p1153
aS'Where it gripped the camcorder, Niko\'s hand was pale. "I didn\'t say that either," he breathed. "I mean I said something about that long, some of those words and phrases maybe.'
p1154
aS'But they\'re _different they\'re fucking different---_"\n\nI shushed him, because the voices on the tape were speaking again. But now the words were familiar, mundane.'
p1155
aS'We both watched the screen, afraid to blink, but nothing else seemed changed. Everything played out as we remembered. Except now every word and gesture caused a spike of uncertainty. _Had_ I said that, exactly that?'
p1156
aS'Had I moved my arm that way, stood in precisely that spot?'
p1157
aS"Screen-Niko started to rappel. The camera focused on my legs as I stood up top, watching him descend. On the screen I waited, then clipped onto the rope once he'd made it to the bottom."
p1158
aS'Screen-Ryan checked his harness, took a deep breath, and started down.'
p1159
aS'He paused before his head dropped out of frame to call down to Niko: "Coming down." I remembered saying that.\n\nThen he turned and looked straight at the camera.'
p1160
aS'Straight into the lens.\n\nHe held the gaze for a long moment.'
p1161
aS'Then he glanced, deliberate, down the shaft. Then back to the camera.\n\nWide-eyed.'
p1162
aS'His head dropped out of sight.\n\nWe sat frozen, watching the video of the empty hall for another thirty seconds, until the tape reached its end and clunked to a stop.'
p1163
aS'Niko breathed out. "Jesus." He closed the screen and sat the camera down, backing away from it like it was a bomb. "Jesus fucking Christ."'
p1164
aS'I kept staring at it. CAVE SEARCH CALLED OFF floated through my head, the headline from the old newspaper article. SURELY NO HOPE LEFT FOR YOUNG SPELUNKERS.\n\nPools as clear as air.'
p1165
aS'"Jesus," he kept muttering. "Jesus."'
p1166
aS'* * *\n\nWe slept in the big room that night because we always had low-level headaches now when we went upstairs. (Also, because I thought I heard someone up there, rummaging in the kitchen. The housemates were all supposed to be at a party.'
p1167
aS'"Hello?" I\'d called, but no one answered. The noises stopped, though.) We were becoming trolls, hiding from sounds, afraid to go out under the sky, only venturing from our cave to get more supplies, stock up for further ventures down.'
p1168
aS"I slept under the foosball table, gathering dust. No one but us had been down here for weeks.\n\nIt won't surprise you to hear I had nightmares."
p1169
aS"I replayed the tape in my dreams, over and over. Each time I rewound all the way to the start, intent to watch it through, make sure there wasn't some clue I'd missed. And each time the tape was different."
p1170
aS'It was always Niko and the pit and I, but never the same. And whenever something changed, fresh dread flooded through me.'
p1171
aS'Sometimes the changes were slight, barely there, and I struggled to catch the altered words, the different glances.'
p1172
aS'Sometimes our words were rearranged, as if to make cryptic cyphers, buried meanings on the verge of making sense but never quite resolving.'
p1173
aS'In some of these variations, Niko and I were boyfriends. A couple. I could tell from the words we used, the way we looked at each other. Nothing that would have been obvious to anyone but me.'
p1174
aS'I replayed these scenes over and over, rewinding to catch the little glances, secret smiles.\n\nThere were other, worse versions.'
p1175
aS'There were dream-tapes where a gaunt Ryan and Niko fought each other for control of the camera, staring manic into the lens with frantic mouths full of rotting teeth,'
p1176
aS"skin flaking beneath torn and faded rags sticky with dried blood, like they'd been trapped down there for months."
p1177
aS'They clawed at the lens, as if trying to climb into it. As if it somehow were a way back out.'
p1178
aS'There were tapes where we cursed out our watcher-selves, told them to go away, to never come back again, that what was down there would destroy us.'
p1179
aS'There were others, far worse, where we laughed like sharks, invited ourselves to come down there, and stay.'
p1180
aS'There were versions where the grapple failed and Niko or I fell, the sound of a sickening crunch reverberating up the shaft. There were versions where we looked right into the lens and stepped willingly off the edge.'
p1181
aS'There were versions where the carpet turned soft and we sunk into it like quicksand, Niko screaming while I smiled until fibers closed over my head. There were versions where hurricane winds sucked us screaming into the pit.'
p1182
aS'And on one tape---and I rewound and re-watched this over and over, in the dream---water from all the hallways poured into the pit, a four-sided waterfall.'
p1183
aS'The carpets were black and sticky with moss trailing down into the vertical shaft, the walls not smooth and white but rocky like cave tunnels, the air thick with steam.'
p1184
aS'Something jostled the camera and it surged forward with the tide, water sloshing against the lens, until the scalding stream carried it over the edge and it fell,'
p1185
aS'straight down into that boiling pit, surrounded by water on every side, gathering speed, falling into wet and steaming dark, faster and faster and faster...'
p1186
aS"I would jerk awake at this point, coated in sweat, and try not to fall back asleep. But when I did I'd find myself rewinding the tape yet again and pressing play, hoping this time the footage would return to normal."
p1187
aS"It was always changed, and I'd have to watch it all over from the beginning, hoping this time I'd catch something useful, a hint, a clue, an answer."
p1188
aS'* * *\n\nI woke to the smell of stale nicotine. Niko leaned against the stairs back up to my room, staring into the dark, a lit cigarette between his fingers.\n\n"Our lease says no smoking in here," I grunted, still shaking off nightmares.'
p1189
aS'He took another drag. "Blow me."'
p1190
aS'I laughed and he flashed me a wicked grin. It felt good to laugh. Even if it was a little bit forced, to make sure he knew that I knew he was kidding.'
p1191
aS'Rubbing my eyes, I sat up in my sleeping bag. After a moment I scrunched over beside him, back against the stairs.\n\nWe steeped in smoke and silence for a long minute.'
p1192
aS'"Did I ever tell you," he finally said, "about that time I went camping by myself, up in Brushwillow?" I shook my head. "Used to do that a lot, after the, uh. Accident."'
p1193
aS"I took that in. He hadn't brought it up in a long time. Neither had I."
p1194
aS'"I went by myself, cause I didn\'t want a lot of people around just then, and it\'s easier than twisting people\'s arms to get them to come with you. Planning around schedules, all that bullshit." He shifted into citation voice.'
p1195
aS'"\'If a man goes alone, he might leave today; but if he travels with friends, he must wait till each one is ready.\'"\n\n"Yeah, Thoreau. You quote that one a lot."'
p1196
aS'He shrugged. "I like it up there. Anyway."\n\nI waited, staring into the whorled beige universe of the carpet.'
p1197
aS'"So this one night I\'m up there, alone. I\'m in my tent, and it\'s dark. Cloudy, no moon. I\'m sleeping fine, on my back, you know, head up against the edge of the tent. And then I wake up, cause I hear something, just outside."'
p1198
aS'He sucked on the cigarette. "Something breathing. Low, hissing, gurgling breathing. Sounded huge, like a bear or something, a big-ass wolf. And it was right on the other side of the tent flap. Inches from my face.'
p1199
aS'Like something had pressed its muzzle against the nylon, that thin nothing sheet of ultralight fabric, and was waiting. It could smell my breath, maybe. Waiting for me to move. And as soon as I did, it would get me.'
p1200
aS'"I still remember what that felt like. Fucking terrifying.'
p1201
aS'"I was too scared to move, so I lay there a long time, hoping it would go away. But it didn\'t. The thing stayed where it was. Kept making those horrible breathing sounds. Inhale. Exhale. Raspy, choking."'
p1202
aS"He dropped the cigarette into an empty soup can we'd brought down as an ashtray."
p1203
aS'"And then I realized where the sound was coming from. The breathing was coming from me. I was sleeping on a root or something, my head had gotten into some funny angle. I was snoring, basically, and woke myself up.'
p1204
aS'But I didn\'t realize what woke me was a sound I was making myself."'
p1205
aS'I was too tired to process this. "Cool story."\n\n"Do you get what I mean, though?"'
p1206
aS'I rubbed a hand over my face, tried to think.'
p1207
aS'"You\'re saying maybe there\'s not... a _thing_ down there. That somehow, all of it is us."'
p1208
aS'"Echoes," he said. "Reflections. The rooms are reflections of our shitty old house, and the things we\'re seeing, experiencing down there, maybe they\'re not alive. We\'re causing them, somehow.'
p1209
aS'And now we\'re ascribing intentionality to side effects. Jumping at our own shadows." He lay back down on his sleeping bag, staring up at the ceiling.'
p1210
aS'I remembered something from a neurobiology class. "Did you know there are more neurons going from your brain to your eyes than in the other direction?"\n\n"So?"'
p1211
aS'"From your brain to your eyes," I repeated, "not the other way around."'
p1212
aS'He blinked. "That doesn\'t make sense."'
p1213
aS'"It does if you realize that vision is mostly the brain telling the eyes what it expects them to see." I rubbed my face again, trying to wipe off the exhaustion. "We think we have two little cameras in our head. We don\'t.'
p1214
aS'They\'re little yes-men, reassuring us nothing unexpected is happening. That\'s why that trick works, with the guy in the gorilla suit. You ever see that video in school?"'
p1215
aS'He nodded. "You\'re watching a bunch of people toss a ball around, and the guy in the gorilla suit walks right through them, and it\'s like he\'s invisible. He even waves. But you don\'t see him the first time, because you\'re watching the ball.'
p1216
aS'Then you watch it again looking for him and your mind\'s blown." He smiled faintly. "Dude in my high school science class swore the teacher changed the tape."'
p1217
aS'"You don\'t see the gorilla because you don\'t expect to. There\'s no reason he\'d be there, so your eyes don\'t notice him. Even though he\'s in plain sight. Standing right in front of you."\n\nWe were both quiet for a while.'
p1218
aS'"So maybe we\'re somehow looking at this wrong," I finally said. "We\'re not seeing something. We keep saying it doesn\'t make any sense. Maybe we\'re just not seeing it the right way."'
p1219
aS'"Maybe." He closed his eyes. "Or maybe there\'s nothing there to see."'
p1220
aS'"Niko." I swallowed. "You think our doubles are the same as us? Like, exactly the same?"'
p1221
aS'"Obviously not," he said, rolling over. "They found different things. Made their own fucking video."'
p1222
aS'"That\'s what I mean." My stomach felt unsettled. I was on the verge of saying something dangerous. He felt it too. I could tell just from looking at the back of his head. "Little differences. Other versions of us. Of everything.'
p1223
aS'Where there\'s no three dollar bill. Who knows. Maybe there\'s versions where both of us, where one of us..."'
p1224
aS'"Go to bed, man. We need to get some fucking sleep."'
p1225
aS'We both closed our eyes and tried.'
p1226
aS'I could feel the camcorder dream lingering, eager to take over again. I tried to fight it off, but I was so tired.'
p1227
aS'"Even if we are the wolf," Niko muttered, just as I was about to drift off, "that doesn\'t mean it\'s not trying to kill us."'
p1228
aS"* * *\n\nI tried to take a midterm and it was a disaster. I hadn't been to class in weeks, which didn't help, but everything I'd learned earlier had vanished from my brain, neurons reclaimed, I supposed, for more important things."
p1229
aS'Then I started hallucinating, questions and pencil marks multiplying and layering on themselves even when I looked up from the test,'
p1230
aS'abstractions filling the darkened auditorium, and I had to flee, whispering a hurried apology to the T.A. that I was having a medical emergency.'
p1231
aS"He told me to go home and take care of myself. I was halfway home before I remembered that phrase has a positive meaning, too.\n\nI'd thought he was telling me to commit suicide."
p1232
aS'Something was in my room when I got back. I stood outside the closed door, dried blood on my face, listening. It sounded like an elephant. Heavy, clopping footfalls made the floorboards groan. Wet, agitated breathing rasped.'
p1233
aS'Dust motes danced at my feet in a strange breeze, sucked under and pushed back out through the space below the closed door, rhythmic. Air moved with faint fleshy sounds, like a hundred quiet people flapping their arms, flailing.'
p1234
aS'I crept away, miserable, and by the time I came back with Niko and he threw open the door in some play at courage, there was nothing there.'
p1235
aS"I collapsed into his arms, sobbing, and he let me stay there for a while until I'd calmed down. I clung to him, afraid if I loosened my grip he'd disappear. Like dad, tucking me in. Gone between one blink and the next."
p1236
aS'He had a perpetual headache now. He kept describing it with the word "throbbing" and only that word, as if clinging to the sound of it.'
p1237
aS"Like using a different one would acknowledge the pain too had changed, grown worse, was no longer caged by the word he'd picked to trap it. I could see how much it hurt him to think, to make words, to move around. He ground his teeth."
p1238
aS"He stood up carefully now, putting a hand against the wall each time, as if his blood was fighting his heart's attempts to lift it to his head, to keep it from being dragged back down."
p1239
aS"My headaches were getting worse, too, but it wasn't the pain that bothered me. It was the strain of always having them that wore on me. Of wondering if I'd have to deal with them for the rest of my life."
p1240
aS'* * *\n\nWe left to explore down the slippery tunnel late that night.'
p1241
aS"It might have made more sense to leave after a good night's rest, but neither of us could sleep, and spending so much time down there meant night and day were becoming academic concepts anyway."
p1242
aS'Niko caffeined up (I was jittery enough already), and we loaded our packs with canned food and power bars, thick gloves, and crampons from the sporting goods store. "12 points of contact ensures solid grip on ice," the box had said.'
p1243
aS"We didn't expect the manufacturer had tested them on slime-covered carpet, but it was the best we could do."
p1244
aS"In my pack was also a gun. I bought it from a place I'd driven past every day on my way to work but never gone into until that morning. The friendly clerk agreed to waive the mandatory waiting period in exchange for the last of my ATM cash."
p1245
aS"I didn't tell Niko about the gun. I thought it would make me feel safer but it just felt heavy."
p1246
aS'It had been a hot day and the old house clung to that heat through the night with grim brick desperation. Descending into chillier air was a relief. With every step down the headaches diminished, our mood improved.'
p1247
aS'It was almost addictive, being down there.'
p1248
aS"We retraced our route through the upper halls to the top of the shaft and reset the grapples. This time Niko hammered them into the doorjamb, face set, until he'd driven the steel spikes three inches into the wood."
p1249
aS"Even so, neither of us really expected they'd still be there when we got back.\n\nWhen, or if."
p1250
aS'Getting down was a familiar exercise now, danger mitigated by procedure and repetition. We retraced our route to the tiled room with the sink.'
p1251
aS'The water was still running, hot and steaming, rushing across the floor to the corner with its angled hallway lined with slimy black carpet.'
p1252
aS"We shined our lights down the hot throat and the steam grabbed their brightness, bounced it back to us innocently. We couldn't see more than a few body lengths down."
p1253
aS'Niko ran a hand through his curls, deflating again in the hot moist air; scratched the hair behind his ear furiously, like a dog with an itch. "Are we sure about this? Really really?'
p1254
aS'Because it sort of seems like a colossally stupid thing to do."\n\n"You have a better idea?"'
p1255
aS'He sighed, looking down the steaming shaft unhappily.\n\n"No, I don\'t have a better idea," he said at last.'
p1256
aS'We pulled on the crampons and the heavy gloves. Harness, rope, knots. Check. Niko pounded two new Grip Monkeys into either side of the angled tunnel entrance. We tied on. Double-check.'
p1257
aS'Then, each holding our rope, kicking hard to sink the sharp toes of the crampons deep into the slimy carpet, we started down.'
p1258
aS'It was slow, hot work. Once we got inside the slanted hall, the steam was oppressive, everywhere: we were instantly drenched with it, like rot-smelling sweat. Even with the crampons our feet slipped.'
p1259
aS'The sludge was deep and slick, a stew of algae and mold and fungal slimes, green-black and stinking of putrefying jungle, of horrible things happening under your carpet, inside your walls. We held tight to the ropes with steam-wet gloves.'
p1260
aS'The walls and floor twisted and bent as we descended, as if the constant moisture had warped them, but the downward angle stayed vicious.'
p1261
aS"It was a gullet. We were letting ourselves be swallowed. No---worse. We were forcing ourselves in. Eager. Like we couldn't wait to be digested.\n\nWe were nearing the end of our sixty meter ropes when everything went to shit."
p1262
aS'All at once we were sliding. Our ropes had gone slack in our hands, no longer connected to anything. There was no time to dig in the crampons; we were already moving too fast, careening down like a grotesque slalom.'
p1263
aS'Neither of us screamed, focused I guess on trying to grab hold of something, anything, but there were no doorways, no light fixtures, nothing but the thick hot slime and the scalding water.'
p1264
aS"I tried to dig my feet into the oozing carpet but my loose rope had entangled me, my pack was in my way, my face was smeared with scalding gunk and I couldn't open my eyes."
p1265
aS"My hand closed on Niko's leg and I grabbed it. A moment later the floor angle shifted and he cried out, threw his body sideways, brought us both to a shuddering, squelchy stop."
p1266
aS"We were soaked through, overheating. Scalding water ran past us down the slope. I blinked my eyes open and saw he'd wedged himself into a kink in the tunnel."
p1267
aS"One of his knees was scraped open and a dull red mark on his forehead was beginning to swell. But he'd done it. He'd stopped us."
p1268
aS'Ropes slithered down the tunnel past us, followed moments later by two grapples still tied to their ends.'
p1269
aS"Niko reached out to grab one with his free hand, but his weight shifted, and he had to throw the hand back against a wall to re-brace, cursing. I tried to snag them with my foot, but didn't even come close."
p1270
aS'They vanished down the tunnel, trailing rope.'
p1271
aS'Niko\'s face was tight. He tilted his head down toward me. "This was a mistake. God, we\'re so fucking stupid. Ryan, man. We have to go back."'
p1272
aS'"Hang on," I gasped, head filled with the roaring of the water, blinking gunk from my eyes. "Don\'t panic. We can do this."'
p1273
aS'"Man, I\'m barely holding on. I don\'t know how much longer I can keep from slipping. We have to try to climb back up."'
p1274
aS'"Back?" I said, confused. "You want to go back?"'
p1275
aS'He stared down at me. "Of course back. Are you fucking crazy? Where the fuck else?"'
p1276
aS'"There\'s nothing good up there. Nothing right." I kicked my foot for purchase, managed to rest at least some weight on a hidden protuberance. "Besides, nothing\'s changed. The plan\'s still the same.'
p1277
aS'This is the best lead for finding a way back to our side."'
p1278
aS'"Are you not paying attention?" he hissed, furious. "Something is trying to kill us."'
p1279
aS'"So let\'s find out how to stop it." I tried to keep my tone reasonable. "We\'re halfway down already. Climbing back up will be hard, regardless. Why not get all the way to the bottom first?"'
p1280
aS'"Because we don\'t even know if there is a bottom." His face was blotched red with fury, with sweat, with the scorching heat of the air. "Halfway? We have no fucking idea how deep this goes. I should have said this a long time ago.'
p1281
aS'You\'re obsessed. You get obsessed a lot, man, let it drag you down. Your stupid records." He took a deep breath. "Well now you\'re obsessed with this place, and it\'s blinding you. It\'s _feeding_ on you, your obsessions. Multiplying them.'
p1282
aS'You can\'t see it, or maybe you don\'t want to, but I do. I\'m looking right at it. Like the gorilla in the crowd."'
p1283
aS'I was angry. "If I\'m obsessed with anything, it\'s with finding a way back. We\'re running out of time. We either figure this out, or we\'re stuck here forever, in the wrong world. We need each other to get through this."'
p1284
aS'I said it again, like saying it could make it true. "We need each other."'
p1285
aS'"You\'re obsessed with me, too," he muttered. "When was the last time you hung out with someone else?"\n\n"When was the last time you did?"'
p1286
aS'He shook his head angrily, dismissing this.'
p1287
aS'"Our housemates," I pushed, "when was the last time you hung out with any of them? Anyone other than me?" He stared back, seething. "Their names. I bet you can\'t even remember their names." I was bluffing. But could I remember them, either?'
p1288
aS"Names, faces. No. There was nothing. None of those people mattered, not to me, not to us. We were the only thing that mattered. Getting back to where we'd been, what we'd had. What I'd wanted."
p1289
aS'He shook his head again, violent, like there was something inside it he wanted to dislodge. "You\'re living in a fantasy," he spat, "you always have been. _I can\'t be what you want me to be, okay?_'
p1290
aS'I can\'t be what anyone fucking wants me to be. You all have these versions of me in your head, these ideal perfect Nikos, but they\'re not real. I can\'t live up to them." He opened his eyes, stared yearningly back up the shaft. "Help me.'
p1291
aS'If you really care about me, help me back up. Don\'t be like everyone else. Don\'t just fucking _use_ me to get what you want."'
p1292
aS'"Going back\'s not going to help. There\'s no answers up there." He wasn\'t understanding. I reached for something else. "Those headaches aren\'t going away. You think you can live with that pain? Forever?"'
p1293
aS'"Better than being fucking dead!" He seemed to realize I wasn\'t changing my mind, turned away to reach for a handhold, but there was nothing there, nothing to grip, and he scrabbled pathetically at the slime.'
p1294
aS'"Is it?" I shouted, angry, desperate. I had to say something, something that would make him stay, keep him here, and my mouth raced ahead of me. "You won\'t make it, up there, not with pain like that. We both know you won\'t."'
p1295
aS'He tensed, glared down at me. "What the fuck is that supposed to mean?"'
p1296
aS'"You know exactly what it means," I said, shaking. "Never really helped you. I\'ve done nothing but help you. I\'ve always been there for you. Every fucking time you fall I pick you back up. _You\'d be dead if it weren\'t for me._"'
p1297
aS'He shot me with a gaze of such cold fury I cringed. "You\'re fucking poison," he hissed, "you know that? A fucking snake. I wish you\'d let me die that night. I wish we\'d never met. _Let go of me!_"'
p1298
aS'And his hand did close on something, and he pulled himself up, triumphant.'
p1299
aS"His leg was slipping out of my hands, and I couldn't bear for him to crawl away from me, couldn't handle the thought of going back up to that world, to any world where everything was wrong and nothing I wanted was possible, so I pulled."
p1300
aS"I pulled, too hard, and both his hands slipped, and he crashed back into me, only I wasn't holding onto anything but him any more so both of us tumbled down,"
p1301
aS'faster and faster, slipping and twisting and scraping together down the steepening blood-hot slope, down and down and down into darkness.'

aS"I'm in the closet at the back of the band room, sophomore year of high school, and this annoying girl, Krissy or Kristy or something,"
p1306
aS"has followed me in to grab the music stands, and she's especially giggly and flighty and nervous for some reason,"
p1307
aS"brushing up against me, and then the lights switch off and she grabs me and I realize it's a setup, she got someone to stay out there and flip the switch: and in the sudden gloom she grabs me and crushes her lips against mine."
p1308
aS'And all I can think of in this moment is Bradley, this cute sweet transfer student who a month before had found out I also liked weird old music, so he corners me after band one day to talk about it.'
p1309
aS'He loves old music, strange music, making weird cross-genre mix tapes, and he plays some for me out of the half-dozen he keeps in his backpack, which is also filled with loose-leaf sheets of staff paper scribbled with notes because oh,'
p1310
aS"he also composes, too, and he's impossibly cute and I'm so flustered, embarrassed, because as obvious as his interest seems now, back then it's not even possible for me to consider it."
p1311
aS"I never once think that he might be like me because I've never met anyone like me."
p1312
aS'We spend hours in the practice room and make plans to hang out again and then the next day in the hall some kid from the varsity team shoves him to the ground, hard, sends his books flying. Calls him a faggot.'
p1313
aS"I'm paralyzed, half a hallway away, frozen while I watch Bradley say something from the ground, a denial, maybe, and the jock is saying something back, evidence, maybe, but I can't hear because my pulse is pounding in my ears."
p1314
aS"I'm too afraid or ashamed to go help him, to say anything at all, risk the ugly spotlight of the jock's face turning on me, too, because he's clearly making a thing of this, drawing a line. Not in our school."
p1315
aS'I imagine a chalk outline around Bradley, red graffiti. A queer died here.'
p1316
aS"I can't move, not even when he finishes collecting his things, gets up, and walks away, taunts at his back, walks down the hall towards me,"
p1317
aS"and now I can move but only to turn away, face flushed and heart galloping, and I can't look at him and I don't know if he sees me there as he passes by."
p1318
aS"But he isn't at school the next day and the week after I hear he's transferred somewhere else, and I never see him again."
p1319
aS"And now in the dark closet as this dumb girl's lips push against mine all I can think is that it should have been Bradley, my first kiss should have been him, and now I've fucked it up, lost it,"
p1320
aS"failed him and myself and even this girl, whose eyes I can't meet either as I pull away and brush past her out of the closet and past snickering faces to the door outside, changed, maybe, or maybe not."
p1321
aS"Her hair was in the way, after all, long straight blonde strands of it tasting like strawberry conditioner, so our lips didn't really even touch, let alone tongues. Was that a kiss? Did it count? Who knows."
p1322
aS"I don't feel like it should, and anyway I don't feel any different except maybe worse, somewhere deep down, even less experienced and less ready and less sure of who I'm supposed to be. I drop out of band not long after that."
p1323
aS"I've always liked listening to music more than playing it, anyway, and I like to listen alone."
p1324
aS'* * *\n\nI plunged into a pool of steaming hot water, instantly immersed, choking. My scrabbling hand found something slimy but solid and pushed against it. My face broke the surface and I gasped, slipping and struggling to my feet.'
p1325
aS'Water came up to my waist. I wiped rank muck off my face, blinked burning eyes open, tried to catch my breath.'
p1326
aS'It was utterly dark. All I could hear was splashing water.'
p1327
aS'"Niko?" I shouted.\n\nNothing.'
p1328
aS'I shrugged off my pack, zipped it open with blind, shaking fingers while struggling to keep it above the waterline, and fumbled around inside. My hand closed on a plastic tube. Glowstick. I pulled it out and snapped it, shook it, frantic.'
p1329
aS'A dim blue glow began to bring the world back, a breath at a time. Churning water was everywhere, white and frothy. Steam swayed. A few steps away a sheer angled shaft climbed back up, lined in oozing black gunk and coursing fluid.'
p1330
aS"The one we'd slid down, presumably. Turning all the way around, the edges of my dim circle of light suggested level hallways, flooded, leading off into darkness in three equidistant directions.\n\nNo sign of Niko."
p1331
aS'Something dark and coiling swirled in the water: my rope. I grabbed for it and reeled it in. One end was still attached to my waist. At the end of the other, my shiny grappling hook trailed tangled green streamers.'
p1332
aS'I searched the frothing surface, but saw no sign of a second grapple, or a second rope.'
p1333
aS'Shutting my eyes, I tried to sort through the confusion of the sliding fall. We had tumbled, together at first, my hands grabbing for his slime-drenched shirt, the sodden edges of his pack. But there was nothing to get a grip on.'
p1334
aS"After those first few moments all I could feel was my own tangled rope, the pasty mulch sliding past me. I assumed I'd gotten ahead of him, or behind."
p1335
aS"But what if I hadn't? What if he'd managed to stop himself again behind me, wedged himself into another kink in the tunnel?\n\nOr what if the tunnel had split, somewhere up there?"
p1336
aS"I didn't want to think about the third possibility, but I spent a few grim minutes duck-walking through the water, old rescue swim lessons running through my head, feeling my hands through the muck beneath the churning surface."
p1337
aS'I found nothing solid. No backpack, no rope. No body.'
p1338
aS"He wasn't here. I was alone."
p1339
aS'Everything in my pack was soaked. I threw out a waterlogged sandwich and watched it drift in the churning current before vanishing beneath the foam, as if someone hungry underneath had grabbed it.'
p1340
aS"I'd lost a crampon in the fall and couldn't find it, so I took off the other one and maneuvered it into my pack. The blue light from the glowstick turned everything the same shades. Black and blue."
p1341
aS'I had no idea if the dripping gun would still work, and was seized by a thick fear now of firing it down here---of how far that sound would carry and what it might attract---but I slipped it into my belt anyway.'
p1342
aS"It still didn't make me feel safe but I tried to pretend it did."
p1343
aS'My flashlight wouldn\'t turn on, even with fresh batteries. "Water resistant," according to the package, but I imagined it had been subjected to an environment outside factory test conditions.'
p1344
aS"I strapped it to the top of my pack anyway, hoping it might dry out and be useful again. I had a dozen waterproof glowsticks, so I wasn't really worried about light.\n\nNot yet, anyway."
p1345
aS"I stared up the shaft we'd tumbled down for a long time, considering. Climbing back up---without a rope, with only one crampon, without someone helping me---seemed impossible."
p1346
aS"I tried to picture Niko up there somewhere, struggling to pull himself back up, handhold by slippery handhold. If he made it to the top, he'd throw another rope down to me.\n\nWouldn't he?"
p1347
aS'I waited a long time, as long as I could stand it. It might have only been a few hours, maybe even less. But it grew more and more maddening to simply stand there, soaked through, bathed in steam and sweat, doing nothing.'
p1348
aS"Wondering if he was trying to find me. Wondering if he'd left me behind. Wondering if he was drowning or dead or lost, somewhere in this maze."
p1349
aS"At last I decided to move. If he'd made it back up, he could take care of himself. And if he was down here somewhere, maybe I could find him. Offer help, if he needed it. If he'd take it."
p1350
aS"Anyway hadn't I said it would be silly to make it all the way here and not explore?"
p1351
aS"It was the deepest we'd been yet. Maybe there were answers down here. Or at least another way out."
p1352
aS'I picked a flooded hallway, took out my keys and gouged a crude arrow into the shitty paint of the wall, drywall dust spilling out. Breadcrumbs, to find my way back.'
p1353
aS"Or show Niko where I'd gone, if he was lost down here too, or came looking for me.\n\n_And if something else comes looking, you're pointing it right at you._"
p1354
aS'But there was nothing to be done about that. I gave the shaft back up one last doleful look, then turned to the hallway and began to push my way forward through the hot, sluggish water.'
p1355
aS"* * *\n\nI wandered. I'm not sure for how long. The black water's surface smoothed once I moved away from the turbulence at the bottom of the shaft, swallowed up the glowstick's dim blue light."
p1356
aS'There were no longer any curious features or unusual architecture: only an irregular grid of junctions. The infrequent side rooms were always empty.'
p1357
aS'Sometimes the floor or ceiling sloped up or down, not always in sync; so the water level would drift from ankle-deep to above my waist, and the ceiling from claustrophically low to beyond the reach of my light.'
p1358
aS"The halls trended wider and narrower, too, in unpredictable rhythms. I worried for a while about stepping into a pit I couldn't see and dunking myself again, but there weren't any. Nor were there stairs, up or down, or even light fixtures."
p1359
aS'Only hallways, branching, recombining, endless.'
p1360
aS'The air stayed steamy, and while the water cooled as I moved farther from the hot inlet stream it was still uncomfortably warm. I felt hot and clammy, thick-headed.'
p1361
aS'Mist swirled in the air, sculpting the dim blue light into strange shapes and shadows.'
p1362
aS"I kept gouging arrows into the wall with a key, kept moving. If I kept moving I wouldn't have to stop, wouldn't have to think."
p1363
aS'Walking takes almost no thinking at all.'
p1364
aS'* * *\n\nI came to another spot where the hallway widened, but this was different. Running along the indentation in one wall was a row of pay phones.\n\nI slowed to a stop and stared, wondering if they were really there.'
p1365
aS'They rose from knee-deep water, six of them each on its own steel pole.'
p1366
aS"The ceiling had risen so high my glowstick couldn't find it, but light stabbed down from somewhere, spotlighting each phone like it stood beneath its own personal streetlight, fierce and bright after hours of flat blue glow."
p1367
aS"Water sloshed as I trudged over to the nearest phone, reluctant but intrigued. Pay phones don't normally live inside a house. Did that mean something?"
p1368
aS'I touched the black plastic of the receiver. It felt grimy and cold. As if in a dream, I lifted it, held it to my ear.\n\nDial tone.'
p1369
aS"I blinked as it droned in my ear. This didn't make sense. If there was no power this far down, surely there weren't phone lines either."
p1370
aS"Some telecom grunt hadn't run a cable all the way down here, snaking it through all these endless halls and vertical shafts, had they? Hope they billed by the hour.\n\nThe sound of the dial tone was uncomfortably familiar."
p1371
aS'Without meaning to, I reached out a finger and dialed a number from an old commercial jingle. Seven sing-song digits.\n\nA voice told me to insert fifty cents.'
p1372
aS"I almost laughed at this familiar banality. I slapped my pockets, but had no change. I hadn't expected to need any.\n\nI put down the receiver, lifted it again and dialed zero, still not really expecting anything would happen."
p1373
aS'After a ring, a woman\'s voice: "Operator."'
p1374
aS'My bluff had been called. I didn\'t know what to say. "Er... I\'d, uh, like to make a collect call."'
p1375
aS'"Please hang up, dial star nine seven, then the number you wish to call. Say your name at the first tone."\n\n"Thanks," I managed.'
p1376
aS"She was gone. The silence hung oppressive in her absence. I needed a voice back on that line. With a couple words she'd made the familiar loneliness unbearable."
p1377
aS'But who could I call? Water sloshed around my knees as I considered the utter inexplicability of my situation. Should I call the police, explain I was lost in my own basement, miles from the surface?'
p1378
aS'Ask the fire department to send a rescue team through my bed, down the vertical hallway, and throw a rope ladder into the slimy tube in the giant bathroom?'
p1379
aS'Or maybe I\'d call a friend. You know, one who\'d believe me, who wouldn\'t hang up thirty seconds into my story. In the movies, whenever someone says "You wouldn\'t believe me if I told you," there\'s always someone to say back: "Try me."'
p1380
aS'This person invariably turns out to be surprisingly open-minded.'
p1381
aS'I knew with grim certainty this was not going to work for me. The only friend I had like that was Niko. And he was gone.\n\nI felt desperately alone.'
p1382
aS'My fingers brushed against the dial pad, hesitating. They punched star nine seven and then kept going, tracing out a familiar pattern, a groove deep in muscle memory. My fingers knew it well.\n\nAt the first tone, I said my name.'
p1383
aS'Something clicked and whirred in the receiver. A pause, and then, a ring.\n\nAnother.'
p1384
aS'Another.\n\nSomeone picked up and said, "Hello?"'
p1385
aS'"Mom." Relief flooded through me like adrenaline. You trust a voice like that on a primitive level, instinctual, in parts of your brain deeper than logic, than thought.'
p1386
aS'She must have heard something in my tone. "Honey? What\'s wrong?"'
p1387
aS'"What, I only call you when something\'s wrong?" I tried to joke, but my eyes were tearing up and my hands were trembling. I held the phone tight against my face. It smelled like old sweat and institutional cleaner.'
p1388
aS'With my other hand I wiped my forehead. Swallowed. "Nothing\'s wrong. Just wanted to hear your voice. How are things? Tell me what you\'re up to." I didn\'t care what she said. I only wanted her to talk and keep on talking.'
p1389
aS"To hear sounds from a normal world and pretend I was part of it. That I'd ever been part of it."
p1390
aS"She humored me for a minute, but I could tell she was worried. And I couldn't think of anything to say that would get me out of here."
p1391
aS'"Alright, star man," she finally said, and my brain flashed to my sixth birthday when she dressed up like an astronaut to bring in my cake. Cr\xc3\xaape paper planets and glow-in-the-dark comets. "Fess up. What\'s going on?"'
p1392
aS'"I\'m... I\'m in trouble, mom." My voice was breaking. "Something\'s happened. You remember my... my friend Niko?" I rushed forward, babbling. "I\'ve lost him, mom, I don\'t know where he is, where either of us are.'
p1393
aS'I fucked things up and I don\'t know what to do. This is too big, all of this is too big, and I... I made a mistake, and..."'
p1394
aS"I bit my lip so I'd stop talking, something pressing down hard on my chest, and gripped the phone like it was my last anchor to reality. Maybe it was."
p1395
aS'She took a deep breath. Let it out.'
p1396
aS'"Oh, honey," she said. "Is it... is it AIDS?"'
p1397
aS'Of all the things to be terrified about right then, that one was so far down the list that my brain sort of tripped over itself, downshifted straight back to first and stalled the hell out. "Oh," I said. "Uh. What? No. No, it\'s not AIDS.'
p1398
aS'Mom. I wouldn\'t tell you something like that over the phone." I took a deep breath, and once again said something I probably shouldn\'t have. I said it with deadly seriousness. "It\'s HIV."\n\nThere was an awful silence.'
p1399
aS"Then I started giggling. I couldn't help myself."
p1400
aS'"That\'s not funny, Orion," she said, but then she was laughing too, and neither of us could stop, even when she kept trying to, kept saying "Orion" again in her serious voice which just set me off more, which set her off again too.'
p1401
aS"And if I could have given anything to stretch that moment out forever, I'd have done it in a heartbeat."
p1402
aS'I wiped tears from the corners of my eyes. "I\'m sorry. No, it\'s not that. I can\'t really explain it. I guess I just needed to hear your voice more than anything. I\'ll... figure something out."'
p1403
aS'"That\'s my smartie." I could picture her expression when she said this; she\'d said it a lot. "You\'re sure it\'s nothing I can help with?"'
p1404
aS'"I\'m sure." The blue monochrome of the glowstick made the pay phone into an artsy abstraction; the blackness around me sucked away all the rest of its light.'
p1405
aS'"Well, you\'ll figure it out. You always have, even when... when there wasn\'t someone there to help you." She took a deep breath. That was a big thing for her to admit. "You know you can always ask for help when you need to.'
p1406
aS'But you won\'t always need to. And that\'s okay."'
p1407
aS'Tears were pushing out of my eyes again, damn it. I leaned against the booth, screwing them shut. "Thanks, mom," I whispered.'
p1408
aS'"I love you, sweetie," she said. "Do you want to talk to your father?"'
p1409
aS'And out of everything that had happened, all the unexplained and terrifying and gut-wrenching things, nothing hit me like those words did. Sometimes words hit harder than a slap. You feel them, like ten thousand volts.'
p1410
aS"They sour everything that came before, ruin everything coming after. That's how those words hit me.\n\nBecause my father was dead."
p1411
aS'"No," I managed in a quiet, trembling voice.'
p1412
aS'"Oh, he\'s right here, honey, it\'s no trouble. Hang on."\n\nI stood clutching the phone, unable to move, to breathe.'
p1413
aS'Faint rustling sounds came over the line.\n\n"Well hey there, son."'
p1414
aS"This is something you probably won't understand unless you've lost a parent. You have to put things away when that happens. Something is gone and parts of you went with it, in ways that aren't always obvious."
p1415
aS"You have to accept that this person is not coming back. You may not want that to be true but it is and you can't change it, and you need to believe you can't change it, which isn't quite acceptance, but still. You do it."
p1416
aS"You put the pain from those missing pieces in a box and nail it shut and you don't forget it or accept it, not exactly, but you learn to stop thinking about it. After a while it's almost like you've buried the box, or lost it. It's gone."
p1417
aS'And then you hear that voice again, and you realize nothing was ever buried or lost or even nailed shut. The box has been there all along, wide open, and everything in it still has exactly the same power to hurt you.'
p1418
aS'It\'s just been waiting for the right moment to try.\n\n"Hey, dad."'
p1419
aS"The words came out against my will. _There's been a mistake_, I thought dreamily. He's still alive."
p1420
aS'Just a dream that a freight truck doing ninety smashed into him on a country highway with a busted stoplight, killing him instantly, taking him away from me between one blink and the next. It made sense: it had never felt real, anyway.'
p1421
aS'Some strange multi-year delusion, not easy to explain but so, so easy to accept.\n\nOr maybe in this universe it had never happened.'
p1422
aS"_Maybe here, he's still alive._"
p1423
aS"This had never once occurred to me since I'd passed through to this side. It was too huge a change. All the differences were so tiny, so inconsequential. Not like this.\n\n_Or._"
p1424
aS"_Maybe it's not him at all._"
p1425
aS"Something inside me withdrew, to wherever small animals go in their heads while staring down looming headlights. Some residual part of me thought I ought to move, speak, react. Get out of the way. But I didn't know how."
p1426
aS'"Good to hear your voice." My dad. He sounded like he meant it. "How you holding up?"'
p1427
aS'"Dad." I wasn\'t in control: I sounded distant to myself, like someone else was speaking. "Dad. What\'s going on?"'
p1428
aS'He chuckled. "We were going to ask you the same question. Your mother and I were a little worried after that call the other day."'
p1429
aS'I couldn\'t think. "Call?" I said stupidly.'
p1430
aS'"From you and Niko." My father hesitated. "We couldn\'t figure it out, son. You want to let us in on the gag?"'
p1431
aS'"Uh. Gag?"'
p1432
aS'"Sure. All that business about _going deeper_."'
p1433
aS'My blood was frozen and my mouth had gone dry. "What?"'
p1434
aS'"You said," he explained, voice still achingly familiar, "you both said the next time you called, I was supposed to remind you that you have to go deeper." He cleared his throat. "That, um."'
p1435
aS'I could hear the rustle of a paper, like he was reading off a notepad. I could see him, squinting through his glasses. "That you\'re not deep enough yet, and you need to keep going. Deeper and deeper. As deep as you can get."'
p1436
aS'He cleared his throat. "Pretty mysterious. What\'s it all about?"\n\nThe ground felt like it was dropping away.'
p1437
aS'"So what\'s the news, son?" my father said, a hint of a smile in his voice. "You in deep enough yet?"'
p1438
aS'I dropped the phone. It swung on the end of its metal coil, spinning slowly. I could still hear his voice, faint and distorted---\n\n"Ryan?"'
p1439
aS'---dad\'s voice, drifting faint from those tiny holes in the receiver, as I backed away, staring---\n\n"Orion? Are you there?"'
p1440
aS"---and my shoulders hit the wall, and I couldn't back away any more but I could still hear his voice coming out of the receiver, so I pulled out my gun and shot it."
p1441
aS"Somehow I hit the dangling receiver on my first shot, and it exploded. Tiny bits of plastic shrapnel cut the air. One whizzed past my cheek and sliced it open. I didn't notice."
p1442
aS"I raised the gun to the boxy metal body of the phone and shot that, too. I shot it again and again until the gun wouldn't fire any more."
p1443
aS'My ears hurt. The reverberations were deafening, echoing endlessly.'
p1444
aS'I pictured compressed sound waves expanding through miles of hallways, like a dangerous thought lighting up more and more neurons, bouncing off skullbone to keep reflecting, multiplying, feeding on itself.'
p1445
aS'A sound crashing up staircases and down shafts in rippling patterns of interference and reinforcement. I stared down at the gun in my hand, thoughts dull, shots ringing and echoing in my head and through the halls.'
p1446
aS'I unclenched my hand and the gun fell into the water, vanishing under the surface without a splash.\n\nThe phone made a distinct, metallic _clunk_.'
p1447
aS'I looked up at its bullet-riddled surface.'
p1448
aS"Inside, something was tumbling down through the pay phone's innards, dinging and plinking past metal obstructions. My gaze moved down, following its invisible path through the body of the phone."
p1449
aS'Finally, the clattering stopped. The gate of the coin return jiggled as something clunked into the slot behind it.'
p1450
aS'Not wanting to, I edged forward. Part of me reached out while another part tried in horror to call my hand back, but it kept moving. It pushed the gate open.\n\nIn the coin return was a small brass key.'
p1451
aS'I stared at it for a long moment. Then I snatched the key and pulled back, turning away from the bank of phones in the same movement. I slogged fiercely on through the water and down the hall, moving fast, not looking back.'
p1452
aS"My ears still rang with gunshots. In the silence, that ring kept sounding almost like a distant telephone, bell clanging somewhere far behind me. I tried to ignore them, but the ghost sounds didn't fade for hours."
p1453
aS'Chapter 11\n\nIn a flooded side room half the floor had given way. Water cascaded down into consuming blackness, no lower level visible.'
p1454
aS'I stepped carefully past the open door and the current rushing in, tide sucking my shins like it was hungry for them, and sloshed away fast up the hall, shuddering at the thought of that black pit.'
p1455
aS"You fell into that thing, God knows where you'd land."
p1456
aS'Soon after, the hall began sloping up. The carpet went from wet to damp, and then, between one step and the next, dry.'
p1457
aS'Up ahead glimmered a tiny spark of yellow, and as I got closer I realized it was a night-light, plugged into an outlet at the base of the wall.'
p1458
aS'Something about it whispered of lightning bugs and sleepy summer nights, and all at once I felt immensely weary.'
p1459
aS'I fell to my knees when I reached the weak light and sloughed off my waterlogged pack, then curled up around the tiny pale glow as if it was a campfire.'
p1460
aS'My face snuggled into the brown whorls of the carpet like the fur of some huge indifferent beast. I slept.'
p1461
aS'My body did, anyway. My mind kept marching.'
p1462
aS"I dreamed waterlogged halls. I trudged. I can't say I explored, because I no longer made any attempt to mark my way or track my position. I searched for nothing, found nothing: just wandered."
p1463
aS'When I realized I was dreaming I tried to break free of the nightmare, but lucidity was slippery, fumbled away between heartbeats, and I kept losing it.'
p1464
aS"I walked halls lit only by flickering sea-blue light and thought of nothing that wasn't them.\n\nOnce, in a long, straight hall of waist-deep water that never seemed to end, the surface ahead of me shifted, swirled."
p1465
aS'Something moved underneath.'
p1466
aS'I stopped short, squinting, and held my glowstick high. The ripples flung its dim light back to me, bunched up and distorted. But I could make out something person-shaped under the surface, swimming toward me.'
p1467
aS"The gun was in my hand: in this dream, I'd forgotten I lost it. Gripped by fear, I aimed it at the thing under the surface and pulled the trigger. But the shots went wide, from the angle of the water or some grim nightmare-logic."
p1468
aS'Whatever it was kept coming.'
p1469
aS"I cringed back against the wall. The thing beneath the water was doing the breaststroke with smooth, efficient moves. It didn't break the surface and it never came up for air. Through the rippled distortions I could see no face."
p1470
aS'But as it swam past, I could see it was wearing my clothes.'
p1471
aS"It didn't slow down. I pressed my back against the wall, cold sweat prickling my face, helpless to stop my head turning to watch it pass."
p1472
aS'It swam to the end of the hall and around a corner, never stopping for breath, leaving a wake of dark whorls and eddies.'
p1473
aS'* * *\n\nI woke with a parched, sticky mouth. My face was glued to the carpet with dried blood from where the piece of phone had cut my cheek. I tugged myself free, which reopened the wound.'
p1474
aS"Wincing, I sat up and rummaged in my waterlogged pack for something to staunch the bleeding, still half-asleep. I'd left my soaked shoes on and my feet felt like they'd swelled to twice their normal size inside them."
p1475
aS"My glowstick had long since burnt out. The nightlight's weak yellow glow reduced the world to a dim circle of carpet, a few feet across. And I was groggy, still shaking dream-remnants from my head."
p1476
aS"So I didn't realize until I started digging for a fresh glowstick that someone was sitting a few feet away."
p1477
aS'I gasped and leapt up, scrabbling back against the wall behind me. I could see only tennis shoes, catching the amber edge of the nightlight, and the faintest hint of a body in the shadows behind them, knees pulled up with clasping hands.'
p1478
aS'Someone sitting with their back against the wall, faint yellow glints in two eyes. Watching.'
p1479
aS"I stayed there trembling for a moment, too afraid to either come closer or flee into the blackness back the way I'd come. I'd left my pack in the circle of light, between me and whoever was sitting beyond it."
p1480
aS'I realized I recognized the shoes.'
p1481
aS'Hesitant, I cleared my throat. "Niko?"'
p1482
aS'The face was so shadowed I could barely make it out, but I thought it smiled. "Hey, man."'
p1483
aS'The voice was cracked, weak. But familiar. Unmistakable.'
p1484
aS'I stepped back toward the light. "Shit, dude, you scared me." He made no move to get up. "What happened to you? We got separated and I didn\'t know what to do. Did you hear my gunshots? Jesus, I\'m glad you found me."'
p1485
aS'I knelt and pulled a new glowstick from my pack, but he held up a hand.'
p1486
aS'"Okay if we talk for a minute first, like this?" he said. "Been in the dark for fucking ever and that thing will murder my eyes." He lowered the hand. "Cool?"'
p1487
aS'It was such a relief to hear his voice again I shoved the glowstick back down, along with a vague sense of unease. "Fine. So what happened?"'
p1488
aS'"Rather hear what happened to you. Tell me everything."'
p1489
aS"So I did. How I'd waited at the bottom of the shaft, explored the water-soaked hallways. I told him about the call at the bank of payphones."
p1490
aS"But I left out the part with the gun, because in hindsight it felt stupid, and because I remembered he didn't know about the gun, and I didn't want to mar our reunion by revealing I'd kept something from him. Something else, anyway."
p1491
aS"He didn't say much. The yellow glints bobbed at times like he was nodding or cocking his head. But the darkness was fierce. All I could really make out were his shoes, and the hands clasped around his knees."
p1492
aS'In the pale yellow of the night-light they looked skeletal, emaciated.'
p1493
aS"Disquiet crept into me, rising through the floor into my feet and up my bones. I couldn't see his face. I wanted to see his face."
p1494
aS'"Hey," I finally said, "this dark is kind of freaking me out. You can shield your eyes or whatever, but I\'ve got to have some light. Okay?"'
p1495
aS'He sighed, as if resigned. "If you have to."'
p1496
aS'I reached carefully for a glowstick the same way I used to walk deliberately towards the light switch in my childhood basement, shepherding growing panic with a forced front of calm.'
p1497
aS'I pulled one out, snapped it, shook it, blinked at the surge of orange light from mingling chemicals, and held it up, anxious, as the light crept toward him.'
p1498
aS"The electric orange was shockingly bright, and he'd winced and held up a hand to block it out. He kept it there for a long moment as I squinted, pupils squirming. Finally, almost reluctant, he dropped the hand and met my gaze, defiant."
p1499
aS'Something was wrong with him.'
p1500
aS'He was changed. Distorted. Something had leathered him, shrunken and withered his features, hollowed his eye sockets. At first he seemed like some poorly made caricature, face a twisted copy of the one I knew so well.'
p1501
aS'But then I started to realize what had happened to him.\n\nTime.'
p1502
aS'He was older. Much older.'
p1503
aS"I was still in the shallows of my twenties, remember. I hadn't been around long enough to see how age inscribes itself on people, crumples parents into grandparents and invalids and corpses."
p1504
aS"I hadn't seen friends lose hair and teeth and muscle tone. I hadn't loved someone long enough to find out what decades do."
p1505
aS'The Niko against the wall looked twice as old as he should have been, maybe more. He was wearing different clothes, but out of his standard wardrobe: the bowling shirt with "My Name Is BONG" on the lapel. It wasn\'t threadbare or faded.'
p1506
aS'Something bulged from the front pocket, maybe a penlight, and his pack leaned against the wall beside him.'
p1507
aS'He held my gaze, waiting. We stared at each other for a long time.'
p1508
aS'I finally broke the silence. "What happened?"'
p1509
aS'He took a breath. Let it out. "You can see what happened." He cleared his throat. I realized now he wasn\'t tired, or strained. His voice was just older. He spoke in short, clipped sentences, like breathing in too deep was painful. "So.'
p1510
aS'Yeah. I\'m not your Niko, man. Okay?"'
p1511
aS'I stiffened. "You\'re... from the other side?"'
p1512
aS'He smiled. "Ah. You still think there\'s just two sides. Sure, course you do." He shook his head. "Guess that\'s how it seems near the surface. A pair of possibilities. Neat. But deeper down, things get more... _tangled_."'
p1513
aS'The word sounded heavy in his throat, dangerous.'
p1514
aS'"What do you mean?" I couldn\'t stop staring at his face, and I swayed with the sick feeling of recognition and strangeness, curdled together by that fierce orange light.'
p1515
aS'"There\'s a lot of space down here, Orion. A lot of possibilities. Most of them... aren\'t good." His glance had drifted down the corridor, but now it snapped back to my face. "_My_ Ryan and I, we got lost. Long time ago. Real fucking lost.'
p1516
aS'We, uh. Never made it back."'
p1517
aS'"Your Ryan?" I looked around, panic spiking. "There\'s some older version of me down here too?"'
p1518
aS'He looked away. "No."'
p1519
aS"After a moment, I realized he wasn't going to say anything else. And then why."
p1520
aS'His eyes flicked back to mine again, as if fascinated by them. He stared with something like hunger. At seeing my face again? At seeing anyone?'
p1521
aS'"Been on my own a long time," he said, as if explaining. "Gotten used to it."'
p1522
aS'Suddenly I couldn\'t accept any of this. "Your clothes." I shook my head. "Your shoes. No. They haven\'t changed. They should be worn down to nothing."'
p1523
aS'He looked away again, out into the blackness down the hall. "Like I said. Lot of possibilities." He cracked a knuckle. "We weren\'t the only ones who got lost. Bumped into lots of other Nikos and Ryans down here. Most of them dead.'
p1524
aS'Sorry to say." He cracked another knuckle, methodical. "But the clothes are fine, man. The clothes fit great." He forced out a barking laugh, abrupt and cold.'
p1525
aS'I wondered how long it had taken his laugh to shrivel down to that emaciated sound.'
p1526
aS'He sniffed. "You get used to it. Stealing clothes. I mean there\'s no Penney\'s down here, so..."'
p1527
aS'"But how do you eat?" I felt angry, not the least because my skin was crawling at the thought of him grave-robbing other Nikos. Other Ryans. "If you\'ve been down here so long, how the hell are you even alive?"'
p1528
aS'He turned back to me again, no longer wistful but with dangerous sharpness. Maybe you\'ve heard the phrase "thousand-yard stare" and maybe you\'ve even seen one before, but I hadn\'t. It _struck_ me.'
p1529
aS'I believed everything he said next, no matter how fantastic. The words were only flavoring on the truth in that stare.'
p1530
aS'"There\'s a room," he began, voice graveling, "not much farther down from here. Different from anything up here. Bigger. A bit bigger." That laugh again.'
p1531
aS'"Some stairs keep going down. And if you follow them far enough, they open up into black empty spaces. No walls. But keep climbing down and you\'ll come, in the end, to a floor. Step off the bottom stair onto dirt, packed down.'
p1532
aS'Stretching out forever in every direction, as far as your light can reach, as far as your legs can walk. The Basement."'
p1533
aS'He grinned, grotesquely. "Endless. And empty. Bits of junk now and then, I guess. Empty hope chests, half-buried in dried mud. Broken table legs, rotten lumber. Naked dolls. But mostly just endless dark, endless quiet. Endless nothing.'
p1534
aS'Except for all the other stairs."'
p1535
aS'"Other..." I swallowed. "Other stairs?"'
p1536
aS'"Most of them go up," he said. "In spirals or twisted landings or long straight flights. Through emptiness, like the way down. But eventually..." He coughed, cleared his throat. "They lead to halls again. Rooms, carpet. Downstairs.'
p1537
aS"But not the same one. Because if you make it all the way back up to the top, to the house, it's different."
p1538
aS'"I mean it\'s our house," he said when he saw my frown. "It\'s always our house. Not exactly. None exactly. But all close enough.'
p1539
aS"Sometimes the foyer's a mirror image, or the front door's changed, or there's one more bedroom on the second floor, one less."
p1540
aS"Or the carpet's different, or the wallpaper, or the kitchen's smaller or there's no bricked up fireplace, or the fireplace is bigger, or there's a fish tank instead of a fireplace."
p1541
aS"Sometimes, maybe one in ten houses, I can't see a difference. But I think it's always there."
p1542
aS'"Each one has that upstairs porch room, though," he went on, relentless. "Your room. And they\'re all filled with your stuff. Little variations again. Sometimes your bookshelf has a copy of _Dhalgren_, sometimes it doesn\'t.'
p1543
aS"That one I always look for. But it's your room, in every house. And your bed you climb up through to get there."
p1544
aS'"But," he added, "but you can\'t get out. You can\'t get out of any of them."'
p1545
aS'"What?" I couldn\'t break his gaze.'
p1546
aS'"Bricked up," he said. "Sealed off. Windows. Doors. Bricked up. Bricks behind the walls too. And behind the bricks. Bricks forever." His fingers drummed against the wall. "Like dead shoots, I think, those houses.'
p1547
aS"Seedlings that didn't grow, didn't ever live to poke their heads into the light. And there's a lot more dead ones than live ones. Thousands of stairs that go nowhere for each that lead back up to a real house, a real universe. Whole."
p1548
aS'So you wander too far down there in the Basement, lose the stairs you first came down from..." He shrugged.'
p1549
aS'"You come across other Ryans and Nikos down there," he added, "from time to time. Wandering. Lost the stairs they came down. Hoping to find the way back to a world with people and a sun and something that isn\'t this. This place.'
p1550
aS"Something that isn't us. They get real fucking disappointed."
p1551
aS'"Sometimes I\'ll meet them wandering the dirt, crying, panicked. I stay away, of course. Can\'t get too close, like you know, or. Bad things happen."'
p1552
aS'He pointed to his temples, and I flashed back to that feeling of wrongness when my double and I had almost bumped into each other.'
p1553
aS'He looked away. "Course they\'re usually dead by the time I find them," he added lightly. "But. Your question. Each dead house has a pantry, food.'
p1554
aS'Once in a while one has power, too, lit up like Christmas, and the fridge is running and cold, and there\'s lunchmeat and milk and leftovers inside. Unspoiled. So there\'s plenty to eat. Just not a lot of, you know. Ambiance."'
p1555
aS'He stepped closer. "I heard your gunshots. That\'s how I found the right stair. Found you. Don\'t know what you were shooting at but doesn\'t matter. _You\'re not lost._ Are you." He glanced behind me, back the way I\'d come.'
p1556
aS'"This goes back up, doesn\'t it? To the surface. The real surface." He closed his eyes. "With light and birds, and grass, and people who aren\'t you or me. I can\'t tell you..."'
p1557
aS"He opened them again and I wanted to shrink back, close my eyes and pretend I'd never seen something like that in human eyes, let alone in his, that hollowness and pain and greed and something else, too, something worse. But I couldn't."
p1558
aS'I could only stare back, cringing.'
p1559
aS'"I can\'t tell you," he said more quietly, "what it would mean to me to find my way back up there. Orion. I can\'t stay down here any longer. I can\'t."'
p1560
aS'Chapter 12\n\nI wanted to find my Niko, but this strange alternate kept arguing against it. Impossible, he said. Like finding a needle in a haystack. Except this haystack went on forever.'
p1561
aS"In the best-case scenario, he explained patiently, we'd wander until our food ran out, then with our last dregs of energy and luck find our way back up to the surface and out, empty-handed.\n\nHe didn't mention the worst-case scenario."
p1562
aS'Decamped in a small empty side room with low ceilings and walls bulging with water damage, we argued. A single weak light bulb stuck in the center of one wall made stark shadow-men play across the other.'
p1563
aS'He insisted the smartest strategy was for us to retrace my steps to the base of the slide and climb back up. "The closer to the top, the fewer possibilities," he said, "the fewer choices. And fewer chances of making the wrong one."'
p1564
aS'When he found out I hadn\'t seen my Niko since we got separated in the shaft, he grew even more convinced. "Maybe he\'s not down here at all. Maybe he caught himself on the way down, like you said, and he\'s up there now waiting for you.'
p1565
aS'Worrying." He gave up convincing me. "Or if he\'s not, he\'ll realize heading back is the smart option. I _know_ he would, buddy." He tapped his head. "Trust me."'
p1566
aS'I couldn\'t deny this plan made sense, but I felt sick. Too much was wrong. "Look. Even if I take you back up there, it won\'t be your world. You can\'t stay. If you\'re on the wrong side too long, you start to feel---detached."'
p1567
aS'I shuddered without meaning to. "Like it\'s rejecting you. Like antibodies swarming. It\'ll kill you."'
p1568
aS'He shrugged. "We don\'t know that. I\'ll risk it. Anything\'s better than staying down here."'
p1569
aS'"It\'s not just that." I felt like a coward, but desperately wanted an excuse, a reason he couldn\'t come back with us. "You know about that sick feeling when you\'re too close to a twin. That\'s even worse than the headaches.'
p1570
aS'So say we find my Niko and get you both back to the surface. Then what? The two of you get a double on campus, move in together?"'
p1571
aS'"No." He sighed, impatient. "You think I haven\'t thought this through, all the time I\'ve had? You help me get back up, I\'m gone. It\'s a big planet. I\'ve learned how to survive. I\'ll never get within a hundred miles of either of you again."'
p1572
aS'"Wait a minute." I\'d had an idea. "That sick sensation, when you\'re too close. We can use that to find him." He raised an eyebrow. "Okay, maybe you\'re right, and there\'s too much space here to find him by dumb luck.'
p1573
aS'But you\'ve got a sixth sense for where he is. You\'re like a magnet we can move through that haystack, feeling for tugs. Any twinges and we steer closer, till we\'re close enough to do the rest by shouting."'
p1574
aS'"You\'re not listening to me, Orion." He was getting angry. He realized it, took a moment to collect himself. "There\'s a lot of space down here. You have no idea how much space. You\'re never going to find him. You need to accept that.'
p1575
aS'You\'ll get us both lost. And I\'m _sick_ of being lost, buddy. Fucking sick of it."'
p1576
aS"He had an intensity my Niko never had---though maybe there'd been something like it latent in him, waiting for the right trauma to pull it out like a loose thread. It scared me. It scared me that I'd never noticed it before."
p1577
aS"He was right. I didn't want to get lost down here, either. I didn't want to end up like him.\n\nBut I also wasn't willing to give up on my Niko."
p1578
aS'I dug out my keys, held them up. "Look. I\'ve been using these to mark my way. There\'s no chance of getting lost. And I\'ve got plenty of food, still. For both of us. So we keep searching. Keep marking the way. Be methodical, map it out.'
p1579
aS'And if the food runs low..." My throat felt tight. "If that happens, we\'ll turn back. But I can\'t give up on him yet. I can\'t."'
p1580
aS'His eyes narrowed, and I could see him weighing something behind them.'
p1581
aS'But then his face relaxed. A huge smile broke across it, and it was so familiar, so him, that when he threw his arms around me and squeezed me tight, I hugged him back.'
p1582
aS'"Goddammit, man, you haven\'t changed at all. Okay." He pulled back, still grinning, and laughed---a real laugh, the one I remembered. "Shit. Like you\'d give me up without a fight. Course not. The fuck we waiting for, then?"'
p1583
aS'He hoisted his pack, started down the hall. "Come on, Ry," he shouted back over his shoulder, "let\'s go find me."'
p1584
aS"* * *\n\nElder Niko was obsessive about marking our way---I couldn't blame him---so we made slow progress. But despite his initial misgivings he seemed committed now to finding his younger double. Even downright cheerful about it."
p1585
aS'We slipped into something like a rhythm, despite the surreal circumstances.'
p1586
aS"He declined my offer of a glowstick, and didn't pull out the penlight or whatever from his shirt pocket, instead keeping close to me as I swung my light around, peering down all the hallways we passed."
p1587
aS"Sometimes, for a moment, I'd forget it wasn't him."
p1588
aS"Then the light would catch the hard-edged crow's feet around his eyes, or he'd ask in nostalgia-tinged tones if I remembered something that happened a week or a month ago, and reality crashed back into me."
p1589
aS'I supposed from his perspective I was like a long-lost friend at a high school reunion, so as woozy as it made me feel I could understand this behavior.\n\nI thought I could, anyway.'
p1590
aS"He didn't seem to need much light. I asked about this and he shrugged, saying he spent most of his time in total darkness. Sometimes, he said, there were long stretches between lit-up rooms, between scavenged batteries or glowsticks."
p1591
aS'My skin crawled when I imagined trying to navigate this endless labyrinth by feel, never knowing when you might step into a puddle of water, a bottomless shaft. A body.'
p1592
aS'I thought of him wandering these halls in utter darkness, face placid, eyes unfocused, fingers skimming the paneled wall, the only sound the scuff of sneakers on carpet. Sniffing for rot at hallway junctions.'
p1593
aS'Feeling on hands and knees for corpses and their backpacks of supplies, like a blind crab scavenging for leavings at the bottom of the sea. I thought of getting so used to this that it no longer seemed awful.'
p1594
aS'That it seemed perfectly normal.'
p1595
aS'As the hours passed the sense that he was keeping something from me, that something was wrong, only grew. He kept asking about the way back up: casually, like making conversation.'
p1596
aS"But he wanted to know what was above the slide, the layout of the rooms before that, which pit exactly we'd rappelled down, whether we'd found the Library Chasm, which branch I'd taken off the Big Room to get down here."
p1597
aS'He was trying to reconstruct the route back out. Maybe this made sense---maybe he was just curious, or hedging his bets in case we got split up, like I had with my Niko---but behind the jokes and easy laughter I sensed calculation. A front.'
p1598
aS'Performance.'
p1599
aS"Now and then I'd ask if he'd gotten any twinges of feeling, hints we were getting close to another Niko. He'd answer right away: Sorry. Nope. Nothing. At one point, annoyed, I demanded he stop for a minute and really try."
p1600
aS"He put on a show of being abashed, of closing his eyes and concentrating---but I could tell it was only an act. He wasn't expecting to find anyone."
p1601
aS'Like he already knew there was no one to find.'
p1602
aS"* * *\n\nWe'd come to a maze of endless narrow rooms and hallways lined with empty shelves of all shapes and sizes, like a fractal pantry."
p1603
aS'Stairs twisted up and down through shelf-lined landings, doors opening onto endless dead-ends lined with more shelves, stained and bent from past weight but supporting nothing.'
p1604
aS'We poked around a space the size of a mansion, cluttered with oddly-sized corners and crannies, finally realizing the whole area was a dead end. There was no other way out.'
p1605
aS'"Maybe it\'s time to turn back," Elder Niko said when we realized this, solemn. We were near the back of the big cluttered space, in a long narrow dead-end with twenty-foot ceilings, flimsy shelves stretching all the way to the top.'
p1606
aS'The air was dry and smelled of dust. "Man, it\'s going to be hilarious when we find out my younger self\'s been topside this whole time. Lounging on a blanket in the backyard, you know, under the sky. Catching some rays.'
p1607
aS'Waiting for you to get out." He laughed, and his voice sounded hollow, swallowed up by endless rows of empty shelves.'
p1608
aS'His face grew more serious. "Or maybe he\'s so lost we\'ll never find him. Orion. I tried to tell you. This place is too big." He gestured around us, took a deep breath, looked chagrined. "It\'s a lost cause, buddy.'
p1609
aS'I think it\'s time to give it up."'
p1610
aS'He took a step toward the door, but I was in his way, bristling. Holding my ground.'
p1611
aS'He stopped, looking confused. "What\'s up?"'
p1612
aS"I couldn't explain my trembling, except for a deep-seated certainty that this was wrong."
p1613
aS'Everything about it was wrong, just generally, but a specific wrong thing was the way this place had taken Niko from me and done this to him,'
p1614
aS"made him into something I couldn't understand and didn't trust, and I couldn't stand this stalemate any more."
p1615
aS'Some yawning possibility loomed before me, like I was blindfolded on a precipice, about to step forward. But I had to know. Better to fall than keeping lingering on the edge.'
p1616
aS'I met his eyes. "Tell me."\n\n"Hmm?"'
p1617
aS'"Tell me whatever it is you\'re not telling me. Tell me what\'s really going on. I want to know."'
p1618
aS'He frowned. "What do you mean?"'
p1619
aS'"Damn it, stop _pretending_. Everything is not okay. You\'re stringing me along and you need to stop it. Be honest with me."'
p1620
aS'"Oh?" His expression stayed pleasantly neutral. I could project on it anything I wanted.'
p1621
aS'"Stop playing games." I clenched my fists. "Stop _using_ me. Look, we can do this together. You need me to get out of here. Both of you do. I know the way back, and I\'ll help you, but I need to trust you. And you need to trust me. Okay?"'
p1622
aS'Looking annoyed, he scratched furiously behind one ear, not meeting my eye. He sighed, heavy.\n\nThen, looking up at me with a resigned expression and shaking his head, he stepped forward, and punched me in the throat.'
p1623
aS'I staggered back, pain exploding from my neck, but he stepped forward at the same time, looking bored.'
p1624
aS'He punched me in the face so hard I spun sideways and slammed into the wall of shelves, something crunching in my nose, and he kept stepping forward, grabbing my wrists and kicking my feet out from under me.'
p1625
aS'He twisted my arms as I fell so I landed face first, and still he kept moving with me, descending with his knee in my back so when I hit the ground his full weight slammed down on top of me.'
p1626
aS'He punched me hard in the kidney, twice, grinding my face into the carpet with his other hand now somehow on my head.'
p1627
aS"My mouth was open but I couldn't breathe, or scream or speak or think for lack of breathing. My throat felt crushed, my lungs paralyzed. Pain like a stab wound tore open my side. I couldn't think enough to move my muscles."
p1628
aS'Never taking his weight off the knee digging into my spine, he pulled something from his bag. I heard a rip, and was so sure it was some part of myself it confused me when I felt no pain.'
p1629
aS"Something sticky wrapped around my wrists, tugging the hairs on my forearm. Duct tape. And now I did struggle, feebly trying to dislodge him, kicking my legs. Pathetic as a half-squashed bug, twitching, not realizing it's already dead."
p1630
aS"In moments he'd bound my ankles, too, and then my knees.\n\nIt had all taken maybe ten seconds."
p1631
aS'I tried to make a sound, to beg him to stop, or ask why he was doing this, but all that came out was a coarse rasp, not even a gasp. So I begged with my eyes instead.'
p1632
aS"He met my gaze, then looked away, dispassionate. He knew what I was trying to say. He didn't care."
p1633
aS'He frisked me: hands patting my ass, my pockets, my crotch. "Gun," he said, impatient, "where\'s the gun?"'
p1634
aS'I had just enough breath back to grunt a word. "Dropped."'
p1635
aS'"Stupid." He cuffed the back of my head. "There\'s worse things than me down here. And worse _me_s." He smirked, but his hands had found my back pocket, felt what was inside. They reached in, urgent, and dragged out the key.'
p1636
aS'His breath caught.'
p1637
aS'He bent down and shoved it in my face, angrier now than he\'d looked while beating the shit out of me. "What\'s this? How long ago did you find this?"'
p1638
aS'My head spun, trying to think of some way to regain control. "Couple," I gasped. "Hours."'
p1639
aS'"Have you used it yet? Gone through?"'
p1640
aS"I didn't want to answer his questions, but I couldn't see how lying would help me, either. I shook my head."
p1641
aS'He stood up and slammed his fist down on a shelf, cracking the flimsy wood. Then he started to pace, furious. Thinking. I groaned and rolled partway onto my side.'
p1642
aS'The pain in my kidney was evolving from a stabbing into a roiling burning sickness, like something inside me boiled, threatened to burst. Breathing felt like forcing air through pipes sealed with rust.'
p1643
aS'"My Niko," I rasped. "Looking for me. Won\'t let you. Do this."'
p1644
aS'"Your Niko\'s dead," he said, and he said it so simply, so matter-of-fact, it sunk into me like another punch. "Found him and got rid of him before I found you. I always kill the Nikos first. Makes the headaches go away faster."'
p1645
aS'It felt like the room was dropping, like he\'d cut some elevator cable I hadn\'t known was holding me up. I didn\'t want to believe him. I fought not to. "No," I gasped. "Bull. Shit."'
p1646
aS"He reached into his shirt pocket and pulled out what I'd thought was a penlight. It wasn't. It was a finger."
p1647
aS'He tossed it onto the carpet by my face and it rolled once, coming stiffly to rest a few inches from my eye. It was cut through at the knuckle and pale and dead. But more or less the right color.'
p1648
aS'"I\'ve killed him hundreds of times," he said, sounding bored again. He was watching me, though, and as he noticed my tears he gave them a small, sad smile, as if touched by my naivet\xc3\xa9. "And you, too, you little bitch. You\'re even easier.'
p1649
aS"Always freeze up at first. Or if you don't, you try to grab my arm. But the same way every time, right? So that makes it simple to break your wrist."
p1650
aS'When you double over whining, it\'s easy to grab your skull and smash it into the ground until you stop moving."'
p1651
aS'He knelt down, turning his head sideways to study my face, as if curious about the effect his words were having on me. "This time\'s different, though. _You\'re_ not lost yet. _You_ know the way back."'
p1652
aS'He reached out and tousled my hair, playful-rough. "And you\'re going to take me there, Orion. Take me back up. Or you\'re going to die."'
p1653
aS'He stood up again. "But this fucking key. Complicates things. You said you\'re on the wrong side, from your perspective. Yeah?" I didn\'t answer; he went on as if I had. "That means there\'s another you who\'s also found a key.'
p1654
aS'The twin key to this one, on the twin side. And if that other you didn\'t get ambushed by his old bestie"---a wicked grin---"he\'ll pop through to this side soon enough. Because.'
p1655
aS'You find a key, you\'re just a few hours away from finding its door."'
p1656
aS'I couldn\'t see how this changed things. "Why does that m-matter?"'
p1657
aS'He turned the key over and over in his hand, staring at it. "Staying in sync. Wasn\'t that always our theory?" It was like he was asking the key. "I think we have to. Buddy. I told a lie earlier. I don\'t always kill you both right away.'
p1658
aS'Sometimes I... ask questions." He scraped a thumbnail along the key. "Find out where you\'ve been. What happened before. The ones who have it worst are always the ones who got too out of sync. With their doubles.'
p1659
aS'There\'s lots of connection points but the higher-up they are, the easier to get---misaligned. Two lasers pointing at each other, yeah? Nudge them just a bit, and instead of meeting, the beams go on forever."'
p1660
aS'I thought of the tunnel with the infinite fridge, and shuddered. "And if two sides lose sync entirely... if things warp too out of true..."'
p1661
aS'He made a sucking sound through his teeth, bringing it to a crescendo and then cutting it off, like a tire popping in reverse.'
p1662
aS'He glanced at me, then back to the key. "That\'s what happened to me. My double and I, we... diverged. And something tore. Or popped, maybe. Forget lasers. Think pairs of soap bubbles, floating in infinite void.'
p1663
aS"They need each other to stay stable. Our universes got too far apart and it wasn't good for them. They're gone now, or too far to ever reach. Dark."
p1664
aS'"But yours..." He grinned even more broadly. "A ripe pair. Undamaged. Still connected. To each other, and to you. You. I can follow you back into them like a thread. Like a fucking thread, Orion. Up and out and back and into the light."'
p1665
aS"This is the part where if I was a spy or an action hero, I'd be secretly digging a knife out of my pocket, working my way free of the bonds, taking advantage of the villain's distracted ranting to try for my freedom. But I wasn't a spy."
p1666
aS"I was a Bio major. I'd never been in a fight. I was trussed up, I couldn't move, the pain was still excruciating, and I had no idea what to do."
p1667
aS'As if to reinforce my stupid squandered opportunity, Niko seemed to notice me again. Abruptly he put the key in his pocket (his front right pocket, I noticed, desperate not to be completely helpless) and dug through my pack.'
p1668
aS'With a satisfied grunt, he pulled out rope, and proceeded to tie my hands and lower arms behind my back, so tight my elbows almost touched.'
p1669
aS'My freedom was slipping away. I tried to keep him talking. "But..." I had to clear my throat, heavy. "If you... if Niko\'s dead---my Niko---isn\'t it too late? How can anything be in sync now?"'
p1670
aS"He paid no attention to this, continuing his rope work. When he'd finished he wrapped the end a few times around my neck and fear spiked through me, but then he lifted me gently to a sitting position, leaning against the wall."
p1671
aS'He went to the pack and pulled out my flashlight, shaking it. "This thing work?" I didn\'t answer: he was already toggling the switch on and off with no effect.'
p1672
aS'He grunted, dug some batteries from his own pack and slipped them in, nodding in satisfaction as the light came on. Pocketing it, he rummaged through my pack, eyes lighting up when he found my cache of food.'
p1673
aS'He ripped open the wrapper on a power bar and took a huge bite, grunting in satisfaction. Ignoring me.'
p1674
aS'"Niko," I said, trying not to cry. "Please let me go."'
p1675
aS"He grimaced, like what I'd said had hurt him, and scooted closer to me, still chewing. He grabbed my hair and pulled back my head. Stared into my eyes with a frown. Like he'd lost something in them."
p1676
aS'"I told another lie earlier, bud," he said, swallowing. "Sometimes those dead and bricked-up houses do have power, like I said. Who knows why or where it comes from, but sometimes they do."'
p1677
aS'I kept my eyes on his, hoping to find some empathy or humanity there.'
p1678
aS'He took another bite. Chewed more slowly this time.\n\nThere was nothing in his eyes.'
p1679
aS'"Power," he said, mouth half-full, "but the fridges and pantries, in all those houses? They\'re empty. All of them. There\'s no food down here, Orion. None at all."'
p1680
aS"I couldn't stop trembling. I couldn't look away from his eyes."
p1681
aS'He swallowed again, shoved the last of the bar into his mouth. Still gripping me with his other hand, he turned my head from side to side, like he was admiring it. "But you and me," he said, mouth full, "other versions.'
p1682
aS'Man, there\'s _so many_ of us. Popping up or tripping down those stairs, those millions of stairs. Lost. Always lost. Pathetic. Eaten all their food. Starving, out of their minds. They\'re already dead, really. Or a nudge away."'
p1683
aS'He swallowed the last of the power bar, licked his lips and the crumbs off his fingers. Then he leaned forward, slow, like he was going in for a kiss.\n\nHe stopped, face inches from mine.'
p1684
aS'"Wouldn\'t it be such a waste?" His breath smelled of processed figs. "Such a shame for all those deaths to have been for nothing. To have served no purpose. Don\'t you think?"\n\n"Niko," I begged, wanting it to mean so many things.'
p1685
aS'His finger touched my lips. "I think you get it. So. We have to find the door this key connects to. We have to wait for your doubles to come through---yours, and your dead friend\'s. Swap places with them. Pass back to your side.'
p1686
aS'Keep things _synchronous_. And then head up, up, up into the shallows, back to the surface, away from this place forever, and synchronicity can go fuck itself." He stood up, reaching down, and grabbed my shirt to jerk me to my feet.'
p1687
aS'He wrapped the end of the rope around his arm.'
p1688
aS'"But we\'d better get moving. Cause your door\'s going to be farther down from here. And best for both of us if we find it before I get too fucking hungry." He gestured back toward the way out of the jumbled maze of shelves, mockingly polite.'
p1689
aS'"After you, amigo."'
p1690
aS"Chapter 13\n\nLike a bitter parody of the exploring I'd done with my Niko, a million years ago, we kept moving. I led, Niko following behind holding the rope wound around my neck."
p1691
aS'He\'d cut the duct tape from my ankles so I could walk, but tied a blindfold made from a damp shirt tight around my face. "Little handicap," he said, "case you decide to wander off." I cringed when he clapped me playfully on the back.'
p1692
aS'"Don\'t worry, bud. If you\'re good, I\'ll tell you when you\'re about to walk into a pit."'
p1693
aS"We searched. At intersections he'd describe each hallway, and casually discuss which way to go, as if we were equals. As if he hadn't threatened to kill me and worse."
p1694
aS'Other than a preference for moving toward anything weird or different, he seemed content to let me choose the direction.'
p1695
aS'He marked the wall, tracing our path with fastidious care---"If we\'re doing it on this side, they\'re doing it on theirs, too"---and on the whole seemed downright cheerful.'
p1696
aS"For a while he whistled something I finally placed as the theme to one of our favorite shows. Just the second bar, over and over again.\n\nLike he'd forgotten the rest."
p1697
aS'From his descriptions, I gathered we were passing through a maze of identical drab halls.'
p1698
aS'The carpet underfoot was sometimes dry, sometimes thick with something that felt like dead mulch and made me stumble, and often slick with slime and mold.'
p1699
aS"We must have been only just above the water table, if such a concept made sense down here. Probably it didn't. Sometimes we'd go up dry stairs to a soaked hall at the top, or along a downward slant that went from squelchy to dusty."
p1700
aS'We were near water, anyway, moving through histories of past inundation. Niko described walls streaked with damage from it, paint browned and peeling.'
p1701
aS"There were few side rooms here, but he'd open the door to each we passed and check it. Bedroom-sized, he told me, all empty except for a small drain in the center of each floor."
p1702
aS'It was hard to keep my balance, blindfolded and with arms bound behind me, and I stumbled a lot. The adrenaline from earlier had worn off, leaving behind a dozen throbbing aches and a deep exhaustion. How long had I been down here?'
p1703
aS"I couldn't come up with a number, but my body knew the answer. Too long."
p1704
aS"At the next intersection I tripped on a rough patch of carpet and collapsed, smacking my chin against the ground. It hurt, and I started crying. Sobbing, actually. I'd never felt more useless, pathetic."
p1705
aS'Niko told me to shut up, and I tried to pull myself together. He sighed, and suggested we take a rest. Sniffling, I agreed.'
p1706
aS'He sat me up against a wall and fed me a power bar, one torn-off piece at a time. I clenched and unclenched my tingling hands; from the elbows down everything was numb. After a while the tears stopped.'
p1707
aS"I wanted to sleep but couldn't bear waking back up to this. I wanted him to untie me, unwind the rope from my neck, let me go. I wanted to get away from him, or better yet for none of this to ever have happened at all."
p1708
aS'I wanted to be dreaming of something other than hallways, and him.'
p1709
aS"I could have none of these things. But he hadn't gagged me. I could still talk. And maybe talking together, like we'd done so much, I could find a way to reach him.\n\nSo I asked him about the things he'd seen, and he told me."
p1710
aS"He spoke of a hallway twelve miles long without a single door or turn. Of a huge labyrinth of circular halls he'd mapped, pressing towards the center, until at last he'd arrived triumphant in the small circular room at its core."
p1711
aS'All that was there was a bent and broke bike wheel. He spoke of caged metal ladders climbing up through vast, dark, empty spaces, rung after rung through nothing but void.'
p1712
aS"He spoke of more connection points between paired dimensions, useless to him since he couldn't find his way to the surface of any---and all _tangled_ down there, he said again. The connections always had some kind of airtight seal."
p1713
aS'Steam-filled wood saunas with a door at each end; school lockers just big enough to stand in with doors on each end;'
p1714
aS'a shower, but vertically stretched, thirty feet of bathroom tile with frosted glass doors at the top and bottom, and climbing its steel fixtures,'
p1715
aS'faucets and knobs sticking out at random from the walls, climbing it all the way to the top in absolute darkness.'
p1716
aS'Because that was another universal feature of the connections, apparently. Your light, whatever its origin, would go out in the space between, like my flashlight in the fridge.'
p1717
aS"He'd taken a burning two-by-four into one and as soon as the door shut behind him the flames simply stopped, not even glowing embers left behind."
p1718
aS'He spoke of curving tunnels made from scraps of sandpaper and carpet samples, of flooded libraries swimming with illegible books, of treacherous mountains of abandoned silverware, poised to bury you alive at the slightest touch.'
p1719
aS'He spoke of vast caves made entirely of stairs: walls, floor and ceiling expanding and contracting in carpeted, ninety-degree edges.'
p1720
aS"More than a decade later, the first time I saw a blocky cavern descending into shadow in _Minecraft_, I had to shut the game down, right then, turn on the lights, walk away. It looked exactly how I'd imagined Niko's stair-edged pits."
p1721
aS'Finally, he trailed off, and we steeped together for a while in the thick, unbroken quiet. I was trying to think what I could say to keep him talking, but he broke the silence first.'
p1722
aS'"You would have gone wild for some of that shit, man. Wish you could have been there." His voice was wistful. "All our crazy, stupid theories. We were wrong about everything. But it was more fun being wrong together."'
p1723
aS'I licked my lips. Maybe this was my chance.'
p1724
aS'"Yeah. Hell yeah," I started. "Jesus, man, I can\'t imagine what it\'s been like for you." _Isn\'t the phrase "I can only imagine?"_ some part of my brain whispered. I shook it off. "I mean, I don\'t know what I\'d have done, if it were me.'
p1725
aS'Alone down here." I took a breath, extemporizing. "You\'ve... done things to survive, and I mean who could blame you? Who\'s to say when push comes to shove what\'s right or wrong when survival\'s at stake?"'
p1726
aS"He didn't make a sound, and I couldn't see his face through the blindfold. But I sensed a tide shifting. I'd said something wrong. My chance was slipping away."
p1727
aS'"_You don\'t have to do this to me._" I hadn\'t meant to say it and not with such pitiful desperation, but now I couldn\'t help myself, couldn\'t stop babbling. "We\'re friends. You\'re my friend. We\'re only going to survive by working together.'
p1728
aS'You don\'t have to keep me tied up like this. I want the same thing you want. To get out, get the fuck out of here---"\n\n"Friends." he interrupted, voice dangerously quiet. "Is that what we were? Back in the day?"'
p1729
aS'My chest was tight. "Weren\'t we?"'
p1730
aS"I heard a scratching sound. A dog itching itself. I couldn't see but had a clear image: he was scratching the hair behind his ear, head tilted, half-turned down."
p1731
aS"Something he always did right before explaining something he didn't think he should have to explain."
p1732
aS'"I\'ve had a lot of time to think, Ry." His voice was still calm. "About our _friendship_. About _us_." I jerked: he\'d rested his fist on the top of my shoe. "Why we ended up down here."'
p1733
aS'I was losing him, or had already lost him, but I didn\'t know how or why or what I could say to reverse it. "Yeah?"'
p1734
aS'"Yeah," he said, lifting the fist and letting it fall back on my sneaker. "I think maybe there was more going on than I really appreciated at the time. For. Example." He punctuated each word with a harder bap on my foot.'
p1735
aS'"We only found this place because of you. Remember? Because you found it, underneath your bed."'
p1736
aS'"Okay," I said, "but---"\n\n"And _that_ only happened," he said, hitting my foot harder, "because we were both living in that house. And why was I in that house, friend? Why did I end up moving in?"'
p1737
aS'"You just said it. We were friends." But something ugly was burrowing up. I shoved it down. "I mean maybe it\'s my fault you were there, sure, but I didn\'t mean to...'
p1738
aS'I mean I couldn\'t have known... you needed a room, and so---"\n\n"I needed a room, and you wanted to help me out. Is that it?" This time he punched my foot, hard: it ached through the shoe. "Why me, Ryan? _Why. Specifically. Me._"'
p1739
aS'"We were friends," I said again, like a mantra that could save us. I was cringing back, eyes clenched shut behind the blindfold.'
p1740
aS'"That\'s not it," he said, but then I sensed him stiffen, twist his head away. He switched on the flashlight and dim light filtered through the blindfold. He seemed to be pointing it down the hallway, back the way we had come.\n\n"What is it?"'
p1741
aS'"Shut up. Did you hear anything?"'
p1742
aS'I shook my head, distant relief mingling with fresher fear. "No."'
p1743
aS'Silence. It seemed to expand in my head, like those disposable earplugs, eating up all the empty space.'
p1744
aS'Finally he turned back toward me. "I think something\'s following us."'
p1745
aS'Some_thing_. Not someone. Oh. "Like what?"'
p1746
aS'"You know about the other versions of us down here." He snickered. "More than you\'d like to. The doubles, and their doubles from the other houses, and so on. They\'re us, more or less exactly.'
p1747
aS'Which is why we get that sick feeling when they\'re close. And because they\'re us exactly, it makes them easy to take out. Don\'t have to learn their weaknesses, because fuck, you already know them." He paused for a moment.'
p1748
aS'"But there\'s... other ones."'
p1749
aS'I wasn\'t sure I wanted to prod, but found myself doing it anyway. "Other ones?"'
p1750
aS'He shook his head. "Ever see someone watching you down here? Like at the edge of your light?"'
p1751
aS'"No," I said, hair rising. "I mean... I don\'t think so."'
p1752
aS'"If you get closer, you can see they look like us, too. Always a Niko or an Orion. On the outside, anyway." The pattern of light shifted as he swung it down each of the other hallways, then back to the first again.'
p1753
aS'"When you get close to a double of yourself, you can feel it. Right? Feels wrong, somehow. Bad. Something to do with the synchronicity, I think, the risk.'
p1754
aS"If the two of you see each other get out of sync, if you understand you've broken it... bad news, and your body senses it. That danger."
p1755
aS'"But. These other things. You get close to one of them, even if it looks like you, you don\'t feel anything at all. And that somehow makes it so much worse." He spat. "Because it means the Lookie-Loos aren\'t human.'
p1756
aS'They look like us, but they\'re not, not really. They\'re something else."'
p1757
aS'"You named them the fucking Lookie-Loos?" I was horrified. "Thanks. Not creepy at all."'
p1758
aS'He laughed a genuine laugh, then cut it short, like he was upset with himself. Like I was pulling something over on him. "They _are_ creepy, dumbshit. They just stand there.'
p1759
aS'They don\'t usually come too close, but if you walk up to them, they don\'t move away. They don\'t move at all. They watch you." He sniffed. "I mean they move their eyes, you know. To track you. Their heads. They breathe."'
p1760
aS'He unscrewed the water bottle and took a swig. "But they don\'t respond to anything you do. _Anything._"'
p1761
aS'He paused, as if to let that sink in. Or as if remembering something.'
p1762
aS'"And if you walk off," he continued, "they\'ll follow you. At a distance. But if you stay in one place for too long, sometimes. Sometimes. They kind of creep up on you. Slow. Edge a tiny bit forward every now and then.'
p1763
aS'Like they\'re eager, but also real, real patient. I woke up one time and two of them, two Nikos, were bent over me. Standing there for fuck knows how long while I slept. Staring. Mona Lisa smiles."'
p1764
aS'He shrugged. "If you sprint for a while, take some twists and turns, you can shake them. Creepy, yeah, but not a problem."'
p1765
aS'_Oh well that\'s fine then._ "What are they?"'
p1766
aS'"No idea." He laughed that hollow bark-laugh again. "Maybe echoes, or waves, or something. Waves and particles. Superimpositions. This whole place, Downstairs, it\'s like some kind of huge multiplier. You\'ve figured that out, right?'
p1767
aS'At least that much? It multiplies. Dimensions, people. Rooms. Ideas. Emotions. Some kind of chain reaction that got started somehow, sometime.'
p1768
aS'There\'s a spring down here," and he was almost chanting now, murmuring, his voice gone strange, "clear waters at the source. Deep. All the water comes from there. Very, very deep.'
p1769
aS'It splits, and splits, and splits again, and keeps splitting. Thousands of times. Millions.'
p1770
aS'And each stream is as big as the one it\'s splitting from, and they shouldn\'t all fit but they do, and it\'s wrong, it can\'t fit in your head, it\'s too big _it\'s too big..._"\n\nHe seemed to catch himself, stiffened.'
p1771
aS'"But the Lookie-Loos," he said, in control again. "They do it too, sometimes. There\'ll be two of them, moving almost in sync. Or four. I think if two bump into each other, they sort of stick together, cluster up.'
p1772
aS'And if those two meet others, they all join up, like a fucking molecule. Snarled in bigger and bigger tangles." He was watching me now, I guessed; I got the sense he was smirking, enjoying the effect the story was having on me.'
p1773
aS'I turned my head nervously in the direction of the hallway I couldn\'t see. "And you think there\'s one back there now?"'
p1774
aS'"Oh, I know there is," he said. "It\'s standing right there, watching you."'
p1775
aS'I jolted back, lost my balance, and topped over, kicking back with my feet and scrambling to right myself.'
p1776
aS"My skin was crawling and all I wanted was to get farther away, except I couldn't see it, couldn't see anything,"
p1777
aS'and _what if a second one is coming up behind me---_\n\nBut Niko was laughing now, and it slowly dawned on me through my terror what that probably meant.'
p1778
aS'"You fucking pussy." He climbed to his feet, grunting. "Dumb of me. If you\'d wet your pants I\'d have to smell it the rest of the way."'
p1779
aS'I awkwardly struggled upright, stood, furious. He made no move to help.'
p1780
aS"But I knew him too well. He might have been bluffing at the end, but only to cover for being legitimately scared. He _had_ heard something down the hall, or thought he had. And he hadn't been teasing when he'd started talking."
p1781
aS'At least some of that had been true.'
p1782
aS'He tugged on the rope around my neck. "Storytime\'s over, bitch. Get moving."'
p1783
aS"* * *\n\nWalking blind into the unknown isn't fun, and gets worse when you're freshly terrified of it. I kept expecting now to walk into a body, someone standing in my way, fleshy and warm and inhuman. Staring. But I didn't."
p1784
aS"To my captor's credit, he never let me walk into a wall (or a pit), although he was sometimes rough with jerks to the rope around my neck to correct me."
p1785
aS"But I was reaching the limits of my endurance. My collapse by the nightlight felt like eons ago, and maybe I'd only slept for an hour or two there, anyway."
p1786
aS'Waves of emotion had washed through me since then, each one leaving its own high-water mark. I stumbled even over level ground. I was barely awake.'
p1787
aS'Niko finally noticed, and agreed we could stop for "a sleep." He let me lie down, but kept my head covered and hands tied. It was better than nothing.'
p1788
aS"It's a testament to the depth of my exhaustion that I fell asleep within moments. This time, I didn't dream."
p1789
aS'I blinked awake some time later, not quite sure what had woken me. Niko breathed quietly, a few feet away. I got the sense he was sitting up against the wall, legs folded up, and I was lying at his feet in the center of the hall.'
p1790
aS"It was dark. He must have turned the flashlight off, not that I'd be able to see much anyway with a t-shirt tied around my face."
p1791
aS'I wondered if I could, very slowly and quietly, wriggle away. Like a worm out of a tackle box.'
p1792
aS'He reached out and nudged me with his foot. "Don\'t even think about it, bitch." But the nudge was gentle, and his voice tired.\n\nWe stayed there for a long moment, listening to each other breathe.'
p1793
aS'Finally, he exhaled, loud, frustrated. "You think I want this?" He sounded desperate. Near tears. "I don\'t. Any of it. Scaring you like this. I\'m not a monster, man, I don\'t get off on it. I\'m doing what I have to.'
p1794
aS'You don\'t get that, I know, but you haven\'t been down here long enough. Nowhere near long enough."\n\nI stayed quiet, afraid to say something that might make him angry again.'
p1795
aS'He sighed. "I don\'t always kill you, either. Or at least not right away. Sometimes, first. For old times\' sake, you know. I fuck you."\n\nThe word _fuck_ stung me.'
p1796
aS'He leaned forward, holding his head a foot above mine. His breath tickled the fabric at my ear. "You do remember, don\'t you? The time we did it?" He sounded concerned. "That night, after I tried to kill myself?"'
p1797
aS"Sometimes when a person is stung their body overreacts. They swell up, maybe so much their eyes are forced shut. It's called anaphylaxis. Unprotected, in the Greek. But the point is it's not the sting that's doing it to you, not really."
p1798
aS'It\'s your own body, blinding you and destroying itself in a misguided attempt to keep you safe.\n\n"Yes," I whispered.'
p1799
aS'"That was maybe the closest I ever felt to anyone." His voice was calm, bland, like recounting a decent lunch he\'d had. "I loved you so much. Not in that way, you know. Not the way you wanted me to. But I figured what the fuck.'
p1800
aS'You saved me. No, not just that." His finger brushed my cheek through the fabric and I flinched. "You _needed_ me. I was _everything_ to you. That felt so fucking good."'
p1801
aS"I was trying to stay motionless. I remembered a safety video they'd made us watch at Yellowstone. _If you're on the ground and a bear attacks you, curl into a ball and play dead. Don't fight back. The bear will win._"
p1802
aS"I couldn't open my eyes, couldn't breathe. Maybe it was the anaphylaxis. Something somewhere was terrifying. Doppelgangers lurking in basement hallways. A camper in a tent, terrified by his own snores.\n\n_The bear will win._"
p1803
aS'His hand moved over the shirt wrapped around my head, not quite touching it, not quite pulling away. "I want to get that feeling back sometimes, you know? It\'s so fucking lonely here. You can\'t blame me."'
p1804
aS'He laughed, so loud and close to my face I cringed. "I mean. Don\'t get me wrong. I\'d prefer a girl but there aren\'t any down here. Just us. Only us."'
p1805
aS'His fingers outlined my face. "Anyway. Doesn\'t work. Never works. Never the same with you." He breathed out through his nostrils and it tickled the fabric by my cheek. "I can\'t trust you. Any of these versions of you. Ry, Ryan, Orion.'
p1806
aS"You seem different but you're all the same. Everything you ever said or did after that. Was bullshit. None of you gave a shit about me, did you? What I needed. Who I was. You just wanted it to happen again."
p1807
aS'"And the next time I tried to off myself, that\'s the only reason you stopped me, isn\'t it?" He rapped his knuckles on my forehead, through the shirt. "Isn\'t it, bitch."'
p1808
aS'"No." It was so soft, I\'m not even sure he heard me.'
p1809
aS'I could feel him shrug. "Anyway, that\'s why I kill you, after. Case you were wondering."'
p1810
aS'He sat back up, wincing. "But sorry, man, not tonight. Got a headache." He stood, kicked me in the side. "Come on. Better keep moving. We\'re close. I can feel it."'
p1811
aS'Chapter 14\n\nSoon the texture of the ground beneath my feet started to vary. First it went glossy-smooth, then to shag, then to changing patterns and textures of creaking wood, tile, and carpet.'
p1812
aS'I stumbled more and more over bumps and irregularities, as if the floor was crumpling, bunching up as we neared some pressure point.'
p1813
aS'Niko opened every door we passed now. At the third one after we slowed down, he sucked in a sharp breath.'
p1814
aS'"Definitely on the right track. You\'re gonna need eyes for this, kiddo." He pulled my blindfold free.'
p1815
aS'I blinked in the sudden glare from his light. He stood between me and the open doorway at the end of the hall. It was dark inside, though I could see something piled up jumbled in the gloom behind him. Bricks?'
p1816
aS'"Take a look," he said with a grin. "I\'ll shine the light. But don\'t lean too far in. I wouldn\'t bet your life on my grip on the rope."'
p1817
aS"Wondering what he meant, I shuffled to the doorframe. He turned and shined the light past me, and that's when the vertigo hit."
p1818
aS"The door opened onto nothing. Past the frame, the floor dropped away into blackness. The flashlight only went so far, of course, so I shouldn't have been able to tell how far down the drop-off went.\n\nExcept I could."
p1819
aS'Far, far below us were tiny clusters of lights. Irregularly spaced, but stretching out in all directions. Maybe miles down. It was like the view out the window of a red-eye, flying over suburbia at night.'
p1820
aS"That wasn't what gave me the vertigo."
p1821
aS"Curving down from the base of the doorway was a complex, multi-colored structure I couldn't at first identify. My impression of bricks was wrong, I realized. They were books."
p1822
aS'A mounded pathway of them: a ribbon of books and long flat pieces of wood, jumbled up like after an earthquake, curving down and away towards a point maybe sixty feet below and another sixty from the door.'
p1823
aS'The chaos converged there into a tall rectangular object, where the sheets of wood became flat and level, interspersed with neat rows of books.'
p1824
aS'A bookcase. I blinked. It sat on a long narrow platform covered in junk.'
p1825
aS'It was as if the bookcase had exploded, but only in one direction,'
p1826
aS'toward us: books and shelves multiplying and propagating outward and upward in an ever-widening wave of fractal repetition, connecting the bookcase to our hallway with a web of itselfness.'
p1827
aS'"It\'s a Confusion," Niko said with a satisfied grin. "Means we\'re real close now."'
p1828
aS'"A what?" I backed away from the horrifying drop-off.'
p1829
aS'"What I call them." He shrugged. "Most of Downstairs tends to follow normal architectural rules. Walls, floor, ceiling, measurements more or less what you\'d expect. Bedroom objects in bedrooms."'
p1830
aS'He played his light along the path of books, embossed titles and snatches of cover art bouncing it back. "But close to a connection point, things get jumbled up. Like it\'s harder to maintain the semblance of order, for some reason."'
p1831
aS'I thought of our fridge, in a kitchen with a pool that had a door at the bottom.\n\n"This one," he added, frowning down, "is pretty fucking weird, though."'
p1832
aS'Still struggling with vertigo (tipping forward, arms bound, unable to stop myself as I plummeted past that cloud of books and tumbled into blackness) I followed his gaze.'
p1833
aS"The stream of book-stuff converged at what I'd at first seen as a narrow strip of ground some way below and in front of us, itself suspended over that awful drop."
p1834
aS"But as I focused on the strip of ground, I realized it wasn't a flat surface, but something more complex: a sort of huge tube or pipe, maybe thirty feet thick, stretching away in both directions."
p1835
aS"It made slow, lazy curves as it went, like an immense statue of a snake slithering through grass. You could walk flat along the top of the snake's back in either direction, assuming you could get down there in the first place."
p1836
aS'Its endpoints, if any, were lost in darkness.\n\nAnd it got weirder.'
p1837
aS'The tube appeared to be made of the same scuffed, dusty hardwood floor tiles as my bedroom. A profusion of tatty throw rugs clung flat to its surface even on the curving sides, like stickers on a tipped-over water bottle.'
p1838
aS'And a motley collection of bedroom furniture was scattered all around it, also attached in some gravity-defying way to the curved surface. No matter the angle, the furniture rose from the hardwood tube as if down was towards its center.'
p1839
aS'A dresser canted at a forty-five degree angle; the top of a bookshelf poked up around the edge of the curve, like peering over the horizon of a tiny planet.'
p1840
aS'So yeah, picture looking down at a giant snake that had somehow coated itself in superglue and slithered through a secondhand furniture store,'
p1841
aS'encrusting itself with beds, nightstands, dressers, floor lamps (some lit), bookshelves, bureaus, trashcans, and laundry hampers.'
p1842
aS'Escher\'s own frat house. And all suspended over a miles-high drop down to god knows where, connected to us via an exploded pathway of library.\n\n"Holy shit," I said.'
p1843
aS'He laughed. "Damn straight. Okay then. Who wants to go first?"'
p1844
aS"* * *\n\nIt was me. Surprise. Niko realized he'd have to untie my hands for me to climb down, and if he went first, there'd be nothing to stop me running off back the way we'd come."
p1845
aS"I'd be running in the wrong direction, away from the supposed portal back to my own side, but I felt like that might be preferable to being the prisoner of a hungry psychopath who looked like a strung-out version of my dead best friend."
p1846
aS"Of course, if I went first there'd be nothing to stop me running off along the impossible bedroom-tube, either. Except I'd have exactly two directions to choose from and Niko would have a birds-eye view on which one I picked."
p1847
aS'Academic, anyway: he retied the rope around my ankle, let out enough slack for me to get down, and wound the other end around the doorknob of the last room back, a few paces up the hall.'
p1848
aS'"This probably won\'t hold your weight," he added, tugging the rope experimentally. "Not for long anyway. But if I brace myself and take some of the load, it should be enough."'
p1849
aS'He explained the plan while sliding fresh batteries into a headlamp and tightening it onto my head: I would climb down the ribbon of books and shelving while he and the doorknob stood ready to catch me if I fell.'
p1850
aS"When I got to the top of the tube-path---the back of the snake---he'd retie the rope to himself, and follow me down while I braced from below."
p1851
aS"He reminded me that since we'd be tied together, catching him if he fell would be in our mutual interest."
p1852
aS"He also mentioned, quite casually, that he had no plans to kill me. Our deal held. Once I got him to the surface, he'd vanish and I'd never see him again."
p1853
aS"If I messed with him, though---tried to untie my rope while down there and run off, or got funny ideas about yanking it---he would hunt me down. He told me of his expertise at hunting me down---me, personally. He'd done it dozens of times."
p1854
aS"He'd know which way I'd choose at intersections. Where I'd try to hide."
p1855
aS"And once he found me, he'd hurt me. He'd spend a long time hurting me.\n\nHe was an expert at that too, he said."
p1856
aS"As if to illustrate this point he pulled out a camping knife with a long, serrated blade and flipped it open: the kind you'd use to saw through small deadwood to make tinder."
p1857
aS"We'd looked at one just like it at the sporting goods store, my Niko and I, but decided not to get it. After admiring it for a moment, he closed it and attached it to his belt."
p1858
aS'I wondered if this was less a threat than insurance against being tied together above a gut-clenching drop. Maybe some of each.\n\nHe watched me watching the knife, with cut-glass intensity.'
p1859
aS'"Time to go," he said.'
p1860
aS'I clutched the doorjamb, trying not to stare down at the twinkling lights far below. Trying to think of some way to get out of this.'
p1861
aS'"What do you think\'s down there?" I asked, buying time.'
p1862
aS'He didn\'t look up, focused on a knot. "I think we\'re above the Basement. The soil, like I told you. The bottom."\n\n"And... those lights?"'
p1863
aS'"You find lit-up stuff down there, sometimes." He sounded bored. "Little pools of light. Oases. A pile of blazing floor lamps, jumbled together like they\'re having an orgy. Wrist-thick tangles of power cords snaking off into the dark.'
p1864
aS'Found a ball of wadded up Christmas lights once. Twenty feet across. All blinking."'
p1865
aS'He pulled the cinch tight. "Rules of geometry don\'t really make sense this deep, though. Maybe we\'re already below the Basement. Maybe this goes down forever."'
p1866
aS'He got to his feet, wincing and putting a hand momentarily to his temples. "Okay, quit stalling. Get moving."'
p1867
aS'"Hang on." Fear sweated out of me. "We don\'t even know if this book path thing will hold my weight. Or if this portal you\'re looking for is even down there."'
p1868
aS'"It\'s down there." He set his grip on the rope. "I\'m sure of that. But as for your first concern..."\n\nHe shrugged, then shoved me, hard.'
p1869
aS'I flailed, but my body was already past the edge of the door, my hands too slow to grab the frame, world tilting at a sickening angle.'
p1870
aS'My sneaker tried to glue itself to the carpet of the hall but my center of mass was too far out, way too far. My head dropped below my feet and I opened my mouth to scream as I began to fall into nothingness.'
p1871
aS'* * *\n\nWith a muffled _whump_, I crashed into the mountain of books. It would have been like falling onto a lumpy, moss-covered slope, except for the edges of shelves biting into my back.'
p1872
aS'For a second I slowed, a faint cloud of dust and wood pulp rising around me, and then I started to slide.'
p1873
aS'With a whimper I grabbed for a handhold and ripped off the cover of a Stephen King paperback.'
p1874
aS'I was picking up speed, scraping and slipping down a slope that was murderously steep, dislodging books that slid away and tumbled down into nothingness. Frantic, I jammed my hands into gaps between them, dug in my left foot.'
p1875
aS'My right was dangling out into the void, but my other three limbs, thank god, were enough to stop me. I gasped, inhaling book dust, heart pounding, and wondered idly if Borges had ever had this particular nightmare.'
p1876
aS'From somewhere above, Niko laughed. "See!" he called down. "Speculate, theorize all you want. Only way to get answers is to dive in head first. Or butt first, in your case." He let out some slack in the rope.'
p1877
aS'"Now untwist your panties and get climbing."'
p1878
aS'I wriggled away from the unthinkable drop-off, back toward the flatter middle of the book-path. I was close enough to get a good look now, and recognized a lot of titles.'
p1879
aS'Sci-fi paperbacks, biology textbooks, graphic novels, biographies of composers. Some of them were books from my own bookshelf, and the rest would have been plausible to find there. Tens of thousands of them.'
p1880
aS'They seemed to be stuck together with something like glue: strong enough for the slope to keep its basic shape, but not strong enough to feel safe trusting your grip to.'
p1881
aS"I looked back up. There was no wall around the hall we'd come through to get here. It stretched back into empty space beyond the limits of my light, wreathed in billowing pink insulation."
p1882
aS"Huge lumps swelled from the sides, also swaddled in pink: presumably the last few rooms we'd passed. It looked like a long pink tongue, thick with diseased bumps, that we'd wriggled to the end of and crawled out the tip."
p1883
aS"Shuddering, I looked down along the path of books, scouting my route to the relative safety of the impossible bedroom's curving surface. The steep slope flattened as the path dropped and converged to bookcase."
p1884
aS'I decided facing the books and right-side up was the safest position to start, like descending an especially literate climbing wall.'
p1885
aS"When the thing became more horizontal, I'd have to twist around and crawl, then drop the last few feet to the top of the tube."
p1886
aS'It was awkward and slow going, in part because I took significantly more care than I strictly needed.'
p1887
aS'I did not want to trust my life to that murderous asshole and a fucking doorknob, or to the integrity of a yellowing Terry Brooks paperback.'
p1888
aS"One handhold and foothold at a time (and ignoring Niko's frequent insults and urgings to hurry the fuck up) I finally made it to the bookcase proper, which stood innocently on the curving top of the tube."
p1889
aS'The books and shelves converged into order as if by magic, like every few inches down were another frame of an explosion played in reverse.'
p1890
aS'I clambered down the last few shelves and stepped onto the dusty wooden floor, unclenching hands rubbed raw and scraped with paper cuts. While nice to be off the ribbon of books, this felt only slightly less precarious.'
p1891
aS'The very top of the huge tube was level enough, but the edges curved down on both sides with alarming speed.'
p1892
aS'The zone where I felt comfortable standing was a rounded summit only five or six feet wide; after that, the slope got steeper and steeper.'
p1893
aS"Looking down the length of the tube, the flat zone of safety stretched forward like a sinuous path, but in no way a clear one. To navigate it, you'd have to clamber over beds, edge vertiginously around angled desks."
p1894
aS'It was as if all the furniture was bolted to that cylindrical floor.'
p1895
aS'Turning toward the sickening curve of the drop-off and seeing the tops of bedroom junk poking up from beyond the horizon a few feet away,'
p1896
aS"I again couldn't shake the sense I was on a tiny planet furnished out of the IKEA catalogue and the dregs of garage sales, albeit one stretched from a sphere into an infinitely long cylinder."
p1897
aS"Experimentally, I took a few steps curveward, wondering if gravity somehow worked differently here; but it didn't seem to, at least not for me. The angle felt steep and dangerous."
p1898
aS'My own "down" was still toward the twinkling lights miles below. Whether the furniture really was bolted to the floor or just obeying its own special rules would have to remain a mystery.'
p1899
aS"I finally remembered Niko, who'd stopped berating me some time ago, and glanced up to see what he was doing. He wasn't there. I frowned."
p1900
aS'The rope tied to my ankle curved up to the lip of the hall, tracing the path of the books, and vanished inside. I was so far below the hallway now I could only see a few feet of walls and ceiling through its open door.'
p1901
aS"The corridor still seemed lit by the refracted glow of a flashlight, moving around somewhere back there, so I figured he hadn't gone far. Maybe he was untying the rope from the doorknob and tying it to himself, so he could follow me down."
p1902
aS"But he'd been at it a while."
p1903
aS'_Shit._ This was an opportunity, and I was squandering it. I glanced down at the rope tied to my ankle, but there were multiple knots, some kind of Navy-ass shit, pulled so tight my foot was losing circulation. Sharp.'
p1904
aS"I needed something sharp. I cast around desperately. A few paces from me was a nightstand with drawers, and I yanked one open, hoping for---I don't know. Something. Anything."
p1905
aS'But there was only junk inside: a few dusty paperclips, a mechanical pencil with a missing eraser. A single red prize ticket from a skeeball alley.\n\nI stared at it, despair creeping over me.'
p1906
aS"Light played across my face. I started and looked up, guilty. Niko was back, peering down distractedly from the hanging doorway, the rope now tied around his waist. He didn't seem to notice what I was doing. He seemed on edge."
p1907
aS'"I think there\'s one of those fucking Lookie-Loos up here," he said. "Way, way back in the hall. At the edge of my light. Doesn\'t matter. Not going back that way, are we? I\'m coming down. Find something to brace yourself on.'
p1908
aS'Brace good and tight," he added, "because if I fall and you\'re not secure, you\'re coming with me, baby."\n\nMaybe that would be preferable, the best fate for all concerned.'
p1909
aS"But maybe he was telling the truth. Maybe he really wasn't planning to kill me. Maybe there was a door up ahead for my key. A way back.\n\n_Without Niko?_"
p1910
aS'My survival instinct shoved the thought away, like a drowner pushing their rescuer down into the choking depths, desperate to keep their own head above water.'
p1911
aS"I looked for a way to brace myself, and that's when I discovered the furniture wasn't bolted to the floor."
p1912
aS'If you gave it a shove, it slid, like normal furniture.'
p1913
aS'But as I inadvertently shoved an armoire two feet farther towards the curve, I hopped back, expecting gravity and momentum to pull the top-heavy thing down and around the slope till it fell over the edge and plummeted into blackness.'
p1914
aS'Instead, it slid a few feet and then stopped, tilted at a dizzying angle but perfectly content where it was.'
p1915
aS'Frowning, afraid to get too close, I reached out with my foot and gave it a solid kick. It slid another foot around the curve, angle steepening towards a ridiculous thirty-five or forty degrees. But it showed no signs of toppling over.'
p1916
aS'It acted, in fact, exactly as if I was shoving it over flat ground.'
p1917
aS'"Bracing myself might be a problem,"\nI shouted up, but there was no response.'
p1918
aS"I figured he hadn't heard---the empty space around us swallowed up sound, creating a surreal distance to everything,"
p1919
aS'like someone had turned down the volume on reality---but when I looked up to shout, Niko was staring back down the hallway behind him again.'
p1920
aS'"I think it got closer." He glanced down at me for a moment, face unreadable, then looked back down the hall. "While I wasn\'t looking. Fucking creepy. In fact..." He trailed off, staring at something I couldn\'t see.'
p1921
aS'My vantage point only showed a couple feet of ceiling.'
p1922
aS'"What?" My stomach churned, as if in warning.\n\nHe didn\'t look away from whatever he was staring at.'
p1923
aS'"It\'s got something in its hand," he said, quite calmly.'
p1924
aS'Nausea swept through me, chemical fear. Hairs prickled all over my body.'
p1925
aS'"It\'s coming toward me, Ry." He was still calm, still staring down the hall. "I\'m starting down in twenty seconds. Figure out a way to brace yourself. Fast."'
p1926
aS"Maybe he was messing with me again. Trying to put the fear of god in me so I'd hurry it up."
p1927
aS"Or maybe he wasn't. I knew what his calm tone meant. What he hid behind it. He was fucking terrified."
p1928
aS'"I\'ve never seen one move like this," he said, voice still calm. "It\'s running down the hall towards me, now. Ryan. Hurry."'
p1929
aS'Something inside me screamed.'
p1930
aS"_He's not lying and something is coming and there's nowhere to run and maybe I should let it get him but I'm tied to him I'm fucking tied---"
p1931
aS'_\n\nI ripped my gaze from the floating hall and cast frantically around the narrow path of safety for something secure,'
p1932
aS'anything heavy.'
p1933
aS'There: a bulky bed with a bookcase headboard filled with knick-knacks.'
p1934
aS'I pushed another armoire, one of the few solid-looking pieces, over on top of it, then scrambled underneath the bed and back over the top of both pieces of furniture, pulling the rope tied to my ankle behind.'
p1935
aS'Quickly I did it again, wrapping the rope twice around the heavy furniture. If Niko fell now, all that weight plus my own should be enough to hold him.'
p1936
aS'"Hurry up," he shouted from above, still staring down the hall, and then _I could hear it_. Footsteps, beating against the carpet. Something running down the hallway, running flat out. A manic run. Fast. As fast as it could.'
p1937
aS'"Ready," I shouted up, not sure which side to root for, not sure of anything but the pulse hammering in my ears.'
p1938
aS'He nodded once, then pulled his gaze away and swung out over the edge, flipping around to face the book-slope, feet feeling for purchase while he clutched the end of the carpet.'
p1939
aS'Focusing on his hands, not glancing down the hall again, he started down. His descent was much quicker than mine, efficient and smooth. But still not fast enough.'
p1940
aS'It was coming for him. The footsteps thudded the hall above, creaked loose floorboards. They were close.'
p1941
aS'"Shit," he said. "Shit shit shit." He was still close to the doorway. Too close.\n\n_What is it what does it want why is it running what does it have in its..._'
p1942
aS'With shocking suddenness a hand wrapped itself around the doorframe. It gripped it tight as a body appeared behind it, skidding on the carpet, coming to a halt on the edge of the drop-off.'
p1943
aS"I shivered as I saw it, every part of me shocked into motion like I'd leapt into an ice-cold stream. I wanted to scream but couldn't. My gaze was fixed on the thing in the doorway.\n\nAnd then I recognized its face."
p1944
aS'It was Niko. Young again.\n\n_My Niko._'
p1945
aS'He raised his hand and shot his older clone with my gun.'
p1946
aS'But even as he did something _changed_ around us. The tube rippled beneath my feet, writhing, flexing. Far below the scattered lights seemed to stretch, expand; new lights winked on in the emptiness between them.'
p1947
aS'Downstairs was growing larger.'
p1948
aS'I looked back up. The bullet had gone wide as both Nikos had grabbed for support in the sudden groaning sway.'
p1949
aS"But now younger Niko was lifting the gun again while Elder scrabbled for handholds of musty paper (_and it can't be my gun_, I thought distantly, _no more bullets_) and younger Niko changed his aim, steadied himself;"
p1950
aS"but Elder snarled, leapt back up four feet of books in a frantic bound, and wrapped his arms around his double's lower legs, hanging his whole weight on them;"
p1951
aS"and younger Niko's knees buckled and he tumbled forward onto the slope with a cry."
p1952
aS"Or maybe it was me who cried out, I wasn't sure, and I couldn't breathe, because both Nikos were snarling, scrambling for purchase on each other,"
p1953
aS'on the gun, on the precarious slope beneath them as they tumbled down it, ripped-off pages fluttering in their wake.'
p1954
aS'They were seconds away from slipping off the side, from plunging into the void of empty space beneath us.'
p1955
aS'"Look out!" I shrieked, but young Niko had jammed his gun hand into a gap between two hardbacks, jerking both Nikos to a halt.'
p1956
aS'The pillar of books shuddered with crumbling pulpy sounds, a hundred rips and tears; a dozen volumes shook free and fell. I felt the same crawling horror of watching a spider fight a scrabbling insect, vicious, instinctual.'
p1957
aS"Elder Niko leapt a body length up the slope and grappled for his double's gun hand. The gun went off again with a muffled thump, swallowed up by the books and the void around us."
p1958
aS'Elder Niko lifted his other arm high and elbowed his double hard in the gut, but was met with a savage kick; he grunted and started sliding again, grasping at slippery covers for purchase.'
p1959
aS'Young Niko struggled to pull his gun arm free but all his weight hung from it now and the collapsing books had closed on it like a vise.'
p1960
aS'Elder had grabbed his leg and was yanking on it; he kicked at the grasping hands, and as he did I remembered something vitally important.'
p1961
aS'"He\'s tied to me!" I screamed.'
p1962
aS'Elder laughed as Niko\'s eyes widened. "That\'s right, asshole," he shouted. "If I go, your boyfriend goes."'
p1963
aS'Niko bit his lip, recalculating (and I hated myself for handicapping him; maybe I deserved to fall) and pushed himself higher with a grunt, yanking his arm free.'
p1964
aS'But as he did the gun caught on a dust jacket, and before he could grab it the weapon was sliding and scraping down the slope. Toward the other Niko, who lunged for it, laughing.'
p1965
aS"In a clear mental flash I saw what would happen: he'd grab it, he'd shoot young Niko between the eyes;"
p1966
aS"his face would go slack and he'd fall off the edge into the void and vanish, and it wasn't that I loved him or couldn't survive without him but something else, a pure flash of righteous indignant anger rising up in me."
p1967
aS"After coming back for me, after _rescuing_ me, when he could and maybe should have left me behind, he didn't deserve to die like this."
p1968
aS'Elder was stretched out precariously, hand only inches from the gun, and without thinking or planning I grabbed the rope trailing up to him and yanked it, with all the strength I had.'
p1969
aS'He let out a _whoof_ as his torso lurched back, all the air forced out of him, and balanced for a heartbeat at a crazy angle, only one foot touching the confusion of books. Then momentum pulled him backward, over the side, and he fell.'
p1970
aS'Everything happened very fast.\n\nThe gun tumbled off the uneven edge and dropped away into darkness.'
p1971
aS'Elder screamed in fury and grabbed for the edge. He caught the corner of a thick hardback but it pulled free from the others, and he fell, still holding it, arms and legs flailing, trailing rope behind him.'
p1972
aS'But dislodging the book had kicked off an avalanche. More and more books were slipping free now, tumbling into nothing like a sand castle balanced on the edge of a crumbling cliff. My Niko scrambled up the slope like an ant in a sandtrap.'
p1973
aS'Losing ground.'
p1974
aS"All this happened faster than movement. Maybe my brain had sent signals to my muscles, but they hadn't arrived yet, or my body was too confused to interpret them."
p1975
aS'Elder tumbled down, rope twisting behind him. He reached toward the cylinder, but it was too far away; he was going to fall past it.'
p1976
aS'He stretched for a piece of furniture instead and collided with it, face scraping against the top of a sideways bureau;'
p1977
aS'a spurt of blood exploded from his cheek even as he scrabbled to get a grip but he was moving too fast and was too heavy for its weight to stop him.'
p1978
aS'His momentum pulled it a quarter-revolution around to the underside of the sphere and away from his grasp, and he kept falling.'
p1979
aS"Above me, my Niko cursed and dove off the collapsing tube of books as it gave way beneath him, and then he was falling too. Only he wasn't tied onto a rope. He wasn't tied to anything."
p1980
aS"I finally moved, lurched forward to do something, anything. But Elder had fallen out of my sight line around the curve, and his end of the rope tied to the bed I stood on snapped taut with a creak, wrapping tight to the cylinder's curve."
p1981
aS'Young Niko plunged by on the edge of my vision in a rain of paperbacks, colliding with a piece of furniture and tumbling with it, but then the bed juddered and groaned underneath me. It started to slide, to pull me toward, around, the edge.'
p1982
aS"I realized I'd made a mistake."
p1983
aS"I'd thought if someone fell, the stress on the rope would be basically downward. The weight of the bed and armoire, especially with me on top, would act like an anchor. Surely enough to arrest a fall."
p1984
aS"But I'd forgotten that down, for the bed---for everything in the Confusion but us---was relative."
p1985
aS"Elder's weight on the rope was pulling the bed not down but sideways, like a bodybuilder tugging it across a floor; and me with it. But this floor was curved. Imagine a magnetic ball bearing pulled around a sphere of iron."
p1986
aS"The force of Elder's weight on the rope was sliding the bed around the tube towards the bottom."
p1987
aS"But the tube's magic gravity didn't work on me. My down was toward the unseen dirt of the Basement, miles below. I was starting down the hill of a roller coaster without a seatbelt, and the hill wrapped past the vertical."
p1988
aS'Chapter 15\n\nAlready I was at a forty-five-degree angle and steepening as the bed groaned and juddered across the floor, leaving deep gouges in the hardwood.'
p1989
aS"_Someone's not getting their deposit back_, a surprisingly deep-seated part of my brain observed."
p1990
aS'I sprang up the steepening slope of mattress, toward the receding safety of the top of the bedroom-tube;'
p1991
aS'but the bed crashed into some other piece of furniture and we jerked sideways, and I cried out and dived for the headboard as the angle approached vertical.'
p1992
aS'I was going to fall off, over the side, and there was nothing beneath me.'
p1993
aS'I cast around for something heavier to jump to, but nothing looked large enough to support my weight. I imagined tumbling into space gripping an end table, maybe a dozen pounds lighter as it tried to fall back up to its cylindrical floor.'
p1994
aS'Which would be no consolation at all as I plunged into nothingness.'
p1995
aS'There was no time. I scrambled onto the pedestal of the headboard, itself beginning to slope as the bed slid around to the lower half of the curve. _No time._'
p1996
aS'I leapt for a bulky chest of drawers six feet away, arms grasping for handles, edges.'
p1997
aS'I smashed into it and hugged its sides. But I was too heavy. I pulled away from the cylinder, dragging the piece of furniture with me off the curving wall of its ground, and we both began to fall.'
p1998
aS'I screamed in frustration and let it go, grabbing instead for the loose rope coiling by my head. The chest of drawers _fell up_, sickeningly, and hit the cylinder above with a splintering crash.'
p1999
aS'An instant later I wrenched to a jerking stop, the rope burning through my fingers: I clenched with a death grip, tight enough to stop my fall, face battered by the landslide of books only now starting to peter out.'
p2000
aS"I took a breath but it didn't help."
p2001
aS'I dangled twenty feet below the bed I was tied to, now dragged around to the bottom of the cylinder, gripping my rope at a point halfway up its length. Another twenty feet of slack curled beneath me.'
p2002
aS'Below that was Elder Niko, swinging from the other end of the same rope, which in between us still looped around the lashed-together furniture above.'
p2003
aS'He had come to a much rougher stop than me and was gasping, momentum swinging him in sickening arcs over the void beneath us.\n\nI looked up for younger Niko, and immediately regretted it.'
p2004
aS'A free-standing doorframe stuck out of the cylinder, about two thirds of the way around the curve to the bottom. He must have grabbed the doorknob as he fell and twisted it, swinging the door open.'
p2005
aS'Now he dangled from the knob of the open door, sideways and slanting down, and as I watched, a bracket holding it to the doorjamb groaned and twisted loose, only two bent screws still holding it in.'
p2006
aS'His hand was slipping on the knob. He looked down at me, frantic; looked over at the bed-and-armoire anchor his double and I were dangling from.\n\nGaging the distance.'
p2007
aS'I opened my mouth to scream _No!_ and he leapt for it.'
p2008
aS"Because the only reason Elder and I weren't pulling our anchor down was that it outweighed us. The pull of the cylinder's strange gravity overruled our downward tug, which was lighter."
p2009
aS'But there was no way all three of us were lighter than that anchor. No way in hell.'
p2010
aS"He smashed into the armoire, shoving it sideways, and flailed for it. The bed jolted with it, its legs scraping across the cylinder above us with his momentum, but it didn't stop."
p2011
aS'I watched in horror as the bed slid off the curve above us into empty space, then began to arc down, toward us, away from the floor above it.\n\nWe were starting to fall.'
p2012
aS"If it had been me, we'd all have died. I need time to consider a situation, to think things through. I don't have split second reflexes.\n\nNiko does."
p2013
aS"He shot a glance behind him and kicked off the anchor, smashing into another bookshelf, this one mostly upside-down, that I'm pretty sure was an IKEA Billy."
p2014
aS'He grabbed for a shelf but it pulled free, designed to resist only force pulling it down;'
p2015
aS"books flew everywhere, but Niko's grip flashed to the solid side of the bookshelf and he jerked to a halt, tugging it across the hardwood above him, grumbling and shedding books like some beast made of library, sloughing its skin."
p2016
aS'But it stopped. It held. With all the books, it was heavier than him.\n\nHis weight now off it, the bed arced back up, pulling us with it.'
p2017
aS'But it hit the floor above our heads with disturbingly gentle force. We even bounced a foot or two back down before coming up to rest.'
p2018
aS'My skin crawled as I realized what this meant: even without the weight of an extra Niko, we came horrifyingly close to outweighing our anchor.'
p2019
aS"The bed groaned, creaking, and one corner lifted again off the cylinder's surface. I looked down. Elder Niko was climbing his rope, hand over hand. Murder in his eyes."
p2020
aS"I leapt up mine, for a second sure I'd be faster. I had a head start. I was twenty years younger."
p2021
aS"But my life hadn't been given over to surviving down here, to stalking, to killing. And I'd forgotten I wasn't at the end of my rope. Slack coiled beneath me. It gave me a head start, but also a leash, tied to my waist."
p2022
aS'Elder reached the loop and hung his full weight on it.\n\nI slipped four feet before my grip on the rope was firm enough to stop me, friction-burned hands screaming.'
p2023
aS'Below me, he laughed, and sprang up the rope like it was a ladder. My arm muscles were already aching. Before I could pull myself up more than a foot or two, his hand closed around my ankle.'
p2024
aS"I strained to pull away, kicking, and again felt the bed shift unsteadily above. I looked up. Younger Niko's gaze met mine; he clung to the slanting bookcase, skiwampus, casting around for a way to help, but there was nothing in reach."
p2025
aS"He couldn't help me.\n\nI looked down and saw the same face, shriveled in a blink by decades of rage into something monstrous."
p2026
aS'"We don\'t have to do this," I panted, still trying to shake my leg free from his cold grasp. "We can all go through, get to the surface. Then go our separate ways. Like you said."'
p2027
aS'"You fucking idiot." With the hand not gripping me he fumbled at his belt. "You thought after all this time down here I\'d _forgive_ you? That we could be friends again like old times? No. You\'re going to die.'
p2028
aS'And then I\'ll hunt that bitch down"---his eyes flashed up to his younger clone---"and kill him, again. First things first, though." And he reached up with the knife he\'d unclipped from his belt, flipped it open, and sawed into my calf.'
p2029
aS"I screamed, trying to pull away, but his other hand gripped my leg tight, and I looked up through the pain and starred vision at my Niko's shocked,"
p2030
aS'helpless, too-distant face, and below me his double laughed and kept sawing with terrible strength.'
p2031
aS'In one fierce thrust he sawed through my jeans and into my skin, and drew the serrated blade back, cutting deeper, into flesh, into muscle.'
p2032
aS'"It\'s your fault," he grunted, and the strength drained from my hands as hot pain sliced through me.'
p2033
aS'"Everything. All of it. Your lies. Your schemes." My blood dribbled onto his face and he spat it away. "A chain of bullshit. Unbroken." He pulled the blade back and I screamed, trying to twist away, but he only gripped me more firmly.'
p2034
aS'"Bet you never thought it\'d end like this, though, did you?"'
p2035
aS"He sawed the blade deeper and I screamed and realized, then, that I couldn't escape this, couldn't escape him,"
p2036
aS"that if I didn't die from falling or bleeding out or being left for dead the best I could hope for would be a life down here in the dark, like him, left to wander forever, trapped, helpless, lost."
p2037
aS"Fighting it was impossible. It was already done and settled, and had been from the moment we'd first set foot Downstairs, from the moment we saw the house, from the moment we'd first met."
p2038
aS'"He won\'t forgive you, either." He grimaced up at his younger self through teeth stained red by my blood. "He just hasn\'t realized it yet."'
p2039
aS'"He\'s not you," I gasped, "he\'ll never be you." And because I couldn\'t make myself believe it I stomped down on his face as hard as I could.'
p2040
aS'He let out a _whoof_ of air and something crunched as a splatter of blood arced out into darkness. His eyes rolled up into his head and he went limp, and then he fell.'
p2041
aS'In thirty feet he reached the end of the rope around his waist and it jerked him to a horrible stop, flailing his limbs like a scarecrow. He dangled there, spread-eagled, face up, over the void. Unmoving.'
p2042
aS'Somewhere above me Niko was whooping in victory, but I barely heard him through the blood thumping in my ears, the high-pitched scream of pain in my leg. Refocusing my eyes, I dragged them down. The knife was still embedded in my calf.'
p2043
aS'As if from a great distance, I reached with one hand, gripping the rope tight with the other, and pulled it free in a queasy sucking motion. Blood dribbled down my pant leg, dripping off my foot.'
p2044
aS'Numbness and pain rippled through me, and muscles spasmed in my arm, but there was something I had to do before any other concerns. Woozy, I pressed the knife to the second rope, and started to saw.'
p2045
aS'"No, wait!" Niko shouted down at me. "The key! Do you have the key?"'
p2046
aS'I looked up, blade held against the rope. "What?"'
p2047
aS'"To get back to your side." His voice seemed distant, swallowed up by empty space. Maybe I was losing more blood than I realized. "Our side, I mean. The right side. The doorway\'s close. It has to be. But you need to get the key."'
p2048
aS'_Front pocket, right side._'
p2049
aS"Below me, Elder Niko still swayed at the end of his rope, eyes closed. Motionless. I didn't think I could have killed him, but I must have knocked him out.\n\n_Or he wants you to think you did, anyway._"
p2050
aS"I still held the knife against the rope. Loose white innards strained free from the cut I'd started, escaping the tension of the deadweight below.\n\nBut the cut was still shallow, tentative."
p2051
aS'Uncommitted.\n\nI nudged the knife closed, shoved it into my belt.'
p2052
aS'"Hurry," Niko hissed above me.'
p2053
aS'"Thanks," I muttered. "Helpful."\n\nI started down.'
p2054
aS'I climbed fast, muscles trembling. The silence unsettled, now that no one was talking or scrambling or trying to kill anyone. It felt like the surrounding darkness was a blanket, muffling, infinitely thick.'
p2055
aS'A dangerous unreality was taking hold, like this was a video game. A dream. I shook my head, fighting mental fog. Tried to feel the pain in my leg, to let it be an anchor to keep me from floating away.'
p2056
aS"I got to the end of my rope and realized I had a problem. When I'd looped it around the bed I hadn't bothered to even out the two sides. And now, at the end of mine, I was still a few body lengths above Niko. I couldn't reach him."
p2057
aS'His side had happened to be the longer one, and the only way down to him now would be climbing the last few feet on the other end of the rope. His end.\n\nWhich meant detaching myself from mine.'
p2058
aS'With one hand I scrabbled pitifully at the knot, but untying it was hopeless for half-a-dozen reasons, my weight on it not the least. There was only one way to get off my rope onto his.'
p2059
aS'Below me, Elder Niko let out a gormless groan, head lolling to one side. But his eyes stayed closed.'
p2060
aS"A strange clarity had descended on me, the disconnected panic that comes from piling bad decisions on bad decisions, realizing you've gone too far but no longer able to stop."
p2061
aS"Shifting my grip to Niko's rope, I flipped open the knife again, and before indecision could paralyze me, I cut through my own rope, just above the knot at my waist."
p2062
aS"It was done. His rope creaked as it took my weight. I tried not to hear it. Tucking the knife into my belt, I lowered myself the last few feet to Elder Niko's body."
p2063
aS'He was still splayed out, spread-eagled, face up, eyes closed. Blood and spittle drooled from the corner of his mouth.\n\nHis fingers twitched in gentle spasms, the last motions of a dying insect.'
p2064
aS'We were surrounded by darkness.'
p2065
aS'Gripping the rope with one numbing fist, I reached out with my other hand, fingers brushing the edge of his pocket. He groaned again, flopped his head sideways.\n\nI pushed my fingers inside, feeling for the key.'
p2066
aS'There.'
p2067
aS'I pulled it free, carefully, gripping tight as the tines tugged the lining of his pocket, caught on its edge.'
p2068
aS'I focused all my attention on not dropping it, not letting it tumble down into oblivion; on pulling my hand slowly, deliberately, out of his pocket.'
p2069
aS'Which is why I didn\'t notice his eyes had opened. Not until his hand closed around my wrist.\n\n"The fuck," he muttered, lids heavy, speech slurred, "you doing down there?"'
p2070
aS'His grip on me was weak, but I felt the gathering awareness in him, like a coiling viper. His face was smeared with blood, and more had rushed to his head as he dangled, making his face look misshapen, swollen.'
p2071
aS'One of his pupils had dilated all the way open, and a blood vessel in the eye had burst, a spidery red blotch reaching tendrils through the white. He looked monstrous.'
p2072
aS'"It\'s all because of you," he muttered, eyelids fluttering closed. "You\'re where all the possibilities spring from. You started something, somehow." He blinked, coughed. "The flow. The troubles. This dream. This. Stream. Irrational."'
p2073
aS'He swallowed, made the ghost of a laugh. "Three eight, three, eight three, eight three eight..."'
p2074
aS'I let him rant. Delusional.'
p2075
aS"But I saw him then with a sudden chill clarity. I understood he was only monstrous because of what I'd done to him. And I'd only done it because of what he'd done to me."
p2076
aS'We were two boys lost in a cave, daring each other deeper, hearing voices but too afraid to really listen, digging doomed rescue tunnels we pretended were for each other, not ourselves.'
p2077
aS'Obsessed with our rippling reflections and ignoring the deeper, colder, dimmer depths beneath. Each holding up a looking-glass we took to be the other, that of course only reflected ourselves.'
p2078
aS'"I\'m sorry," I said, gently pulling free of his grip and slipping the key into my pocket. He scrabbled at my waist with his other hand, pathetic, as if trying to get a grip on my belt to pull himself up. "Sorry for dragging you down here.'
p2079
aS'You deserved... someone better than me to be your friend. And you can hurt me, hunt me, kill me as many times as you want but it\'ll never change that. Never take it back." I took a deep breath. "But I can\'t let you do it any more.'
p2080
aS'You don\'t deserve to die, but..." My eyes flicked up, then back to his. "Neither does he."'
p2081
aS'He smiled, blood spilling from the corner of his mouth, and as it dribbled away something changed. Like the light had shifted, popped a shadow into a shape. Like noticing the gorilla in the crowd.'
p2082
aS'The confusion in his eyes had been a lie. They were perfectly clear.\n\n"Too bad," he said, "no one gets what they deserve."'
p2083
aS"He had the knife in his hand. My belt. He'd slipped it off my belt while I was babbling."
p2084
aS"I swung sideways as he lunged it at my face, and it nicked my ear. There was no grogginess in him, no disorientation. I'd just seen what I'd wanted to see, one last time. I'd never really seen him at all."
p2085
aS"My muscles tensed to fling myself back up the rope, but without the knife I'd never make it. Never be free of him. Certainty flushed through me. This had to end. This had to be the last time."
p2086
aS'He lunged again and I grabbed his wrist, wrenching it backwards, trying to pull the knife free. He snarled and reached for me with his other hand but I twisted away.'
p2087
aS"We swayed and twirled at the end of the rope, the rope I was no longer tied to, clinging instead with one desperate, trembling hand. I felt fibers snapping as the cut I'd started above us frayed, grew larger."
p2088
aS'One way or another this was about to end.'
p2089
aS'He stabbed at my face again and I swung to the side, just enough for his hand to brush past me, so I bit down on it as hard as I could. He swore as I ground down harder, feeling flesh give, tasting blood.'
p2090
aS"Sensing his grip loosen, I snatched the knife, his expression of shock burned into my vision even as I turned away, already climbing. Maybe I'd never done that before, in all the times he'd attacked me. Maybe I'd never fought back."
p2091
aS'I climbed, the knife clenched between my teeth. For a fleeting moment, and maybe for the first time in my life, I felt like a badass.'
p2092
aS"But I'd bought myself only seconds and not enough. I'd pushed well past the limit of my endurance. I barely had the strength to pull myself up. I'd put a few body lengths between us, but he could swallow that lead in seconds."
p2093
aS'I was a wounded rabbit limping from a wolf.'
p2094
aS'Below me something screamed and I realized it was him; a terrible scream, rage and pain and loneliness and betrayal etched onto air. He started up the rope after me.'
p2095
aS'"Get. Back. Here." He growled. "Get the fuck. Back down here. I\'m not finished. With you."'
p2096
aS'Bloodstained rage twisted his face. He was gaining. He was going to kill me.\n\nAnd then a dictionary clobbered him in the face.'
p2097
aS'I looked up, shocked, at a triumphant Niko shaking a fist down at us. "Leave him the fuck alone, dickweed!"'
p2098
aS"He'd clambered up on the tilted side of the bookshelf, another heavy hardback already in his hand. He hefted it, gaged the distance, and flung."
p2099
aS"It curved as the cylinder's gravity tugged it around, hyperbolic, and went wide, whipping underneath us and then back up toward the floor. Any harder and he'd have launched it into a miniature orbit. But he'd already grabbed another book."
p2100
aS'Below me, his elder was shaking off the blow.\n\nI climbed.'
p2101
aS'Niko kept throwing books, and some collided with my pursuer, enough to throw him off balance, to buy me more seconds. I needed every one. I was fading fast, and so was the rope. Muscles tore and fibers snapped.'
p2102
aS'My vision shrunk to a wavering tunnel, only my hands and the rope visible in the deepening blackness.'
p2103
aS'I climbed.'
p2104
aS"I climbed with some reserve of strength I'd never guessed I had.\n\nI reached the notch in the rope and climbed a few feet past it, spit the knife into my hand, and started to saw."
p2105
aS'"Faster," someone was muttering, maybe me, "faster."'
p2106
aS"The Niko below flung himself up the rope. He'd almost reached me."
p2107
aS"A crushing inevitability pressed into me, from tingling arms to kicking feet. Someone had already won. Someone would live. The clock would run out and we'd find out who.\n\n_Faster._"
p2108
aS'Fibers twisted, stretched, broke free.\n\nA copy of _Dhalgren_ arced smoothly by my head.'
p2109
aS'Guttural noises just beneath me. It was too late. He was here.\n\nAnd then the rope split.'
p2110
aS'He was at my feet. He flung himself at them when he heard the tear of the rope giving way, but had nothing to push off, no momentum to save him.'
p2111
aS'He scrambled frantic as the rope went weightless in his hands, a finger brushing my shoe, and for an instant it was as if the cylinder above was toying with him, uncertain whether to hold him with its gravity.'
p2112
aS'Whether he had become enough a part of this place that its attraction should compel him, too.\n\nThen he fell.'
p2113
aS"Within a second he'd plunged past the range of our lights, swallowed by blackness. Only then, after losing sight of him, did he scream, and there was no fear in it at all. Just rage."
p2114
aS'But it was a tiny sound, lost in vanishing darkness, fading fast and not repeated.'
p2115
aS'He was gone.'
p2116
aS'PART THREE\n\nMANIFOLDWISE\n\nFrom W. H. Auden:\n\n"How should we like it were stars to burn\nWith a passion for us we could not return?"'
p2117
aS"Chapter 16\n\nI woke up from a dreamless sleep to face the unpleasant truth that we couldn't stay here forever."
p2118
aS"Getting back on top of the cylinder had been a problem of broken physics. We couldn't just climb back up, because there was nothing heavy enough to grip."
p2119
aS'Maybe a master climber could have started from the bottom of a giant tube of carpet and made his way to the top, but even for Niko climbing had only ever been a fleeting hobby.'
p2120
aS"I'd managed to pull myself up to the top of the rope on the last of my shredded muscles and shove my arms into the gap between the bed and the floor, dangling by my armpits. Niko, farther up, worked out a plan."
p2121
aS"I wasn't too coherent, but I gather he'd scoped out a route from one piece of furniture to the next, and then, in what would have been the most viral parkour video ever if YouTube had been invented yet,"
p2122
aS'leapt from one to the other, pushing off each one as his weight lifted it off the ground, till gasping, he scrabbled up to the top of the tube.'
p2123
aS'From there it was simply a matter of making an anchor of a stack of fallen books, and flinging it around the tube to make a circular guide rope.'
p2124
aS"I had to rest for a while before I felt confident enough to make the climb around. But it was only thirty feet, and only a small part of that vertical. Before I could overthink it I'd done it and was back on top."
p2125
aS'I thought nothing in the world had ever felt so good as lying on my back on a floor, every muscle gloriously unclenched.'
p2126
aS'Wedged in between two dressers, so as not to roll off the edge, we slept. His idea.'
p2127
aS"When we woke we ate power bars from Niko's pack: my own had gotten lost somewhere in the fight, probably sliding off the curve and down into the darkness below."
p2128
aS"I had no idea where to go from here---although it seemed like there were only two options, one way down the tube or the other---but Niko had found a better option while he'd been scrambling around up top."
p2129
aS'Directly at the foot of the bookshelf, whose fractal overspill had all collapsed and fallen into darkness, was a trapdoor.'
p2130
aS'It opened downward with a creak when you pushed on it, releasing fold-up stairs like the ones that sometimes climb into attics. The stairs descended some fifteen feet to a cement floor bisecting the cylinder.'
p2131
aS'Its upper half was a domed tunnel, vanishing into the distance in either direction. Bare bulbs hung from the roof every fifty feet or so, leaking dim puddles of yellow-orange glow.'
p2132
aS'Water ran down the center in a foot-deep trench, fast enough to gurgle.\n\nWe kept to the level ground on either side of the trench, and started trudging.'
p2133
aS'We moved slowly. Niko had cleaned up the cut in my lower leg as best he could, surprisingly tender, bandaging it with some socks from a dresser drawer and a tight-wrapped bungee cord from his pack. But it hurt, a lot.'
p2134
aS"I hobbled more than walked, had to stop for frequent breaks, or lean on him for support. He helped me without comment, when I needed it.\n\nI couldn't help notice, up close to him like that, that he seemed to have all his fingers."
p2135
aS'Unsaid things festered between us.'
p2136
aS'The tunnel had no perceptible slope, but the water in the trench ran fast, rushing eagerly past us. The path curved gently left, then gently right. We walked for what felt like a long time.'
p2137
aS'Gradually, the perfect curve of the ceiling began to straighten. The roof above flattened, the curves at its edge sharpening, until they squared off entirely. At the same time the tunnel gradually shrunk back to house-sized dimensions.'
p2138
aS'Presently we were walking down a rectangular hall of concrete, like some forgotten subbasement in a shuttered factory. It felt like we were back "inside" again.'
p2139
aS'The sensation of walking through a pipe suspended over empty space receded, and we felt once again embedded in earth.'
p2140
aS"There were no side doors, no other stairs up. There were no decisions to make. We just walked. Other than an occasional grunt or word of coordination, we didn't speak."
p2141
aS"I sometimes saw him looking at me, out of the corner of my eye, but I couldn't look back. A small part of me wanted to ask a million questions. Another part didn't want the answers."
p2142
aS"There was a tautness between us, a strain, like a handshake stripped down to bone and gristle, rubbing, raw. I realized maybe it had been there a long time, underneath everything we'd wrapped around it."
p2143
aS'Mostly we were just too tired for talking.'
p2144
aS'Up ahead, the tunnel opened into a larger room. After a few more minutes of trudging we reached it.'
p2145
aS"It was a vaulted brick antechamber, maybe thirty feet across and hexagonal, with tunnels coming in from all six sides. Each seemed identical to the one we'd entered from."
p2146
aS'Water flooded the sunken floor of the chamber and ran out the trenches in the middle of each tunnel.'
p2147
aS"In the center of the room, under the water, was a stubby concrete pillar topped by a metal hatchway with a wheel, like something you'd see on a submarine.\n\nI knew before checking that the hatch would have a keyhole."
p2148
aS'Once we confirmed it did, we became strangely hesitant, our momentum lost. We perched on the lip of a tunnel, dangling our feet in the water, using the excuse that we needed a rest.'
p2149
aS"There was so much I should be asking him, so much I should be saying, but I couldn't find a way to start."
p2150
aS"Well. I had pretended nothing was wrong for such a long time. Maybe another few minutes wouldn't hurt."
p2151
aS"* * *\n\nThe rippling sounds of the water were peaceful, and I didn't want to break the silence. But someone had to."
p2152
aS'"So." The sound echoed off vaulted brick. I coughed. "We\'ve come all this way. We going through, or what?"'
p2153
aS'The words seemed to shake him out of a daze, and he perked up, flashing a huge grin. "Hell yeah! Let\'s do it. Let\'s go home."'
p2154
aS'We waded over to the hatchway. The wheel was inches under the surface of the water. I pulled the key from my pocket and slipped it into the lock, and it went in smoothly.'
p2155
aS'I spun it through a full turn till it made a tiny _chunk_, then turned the wheel. After a few revolutions, something gave, and we found we could swing the circular hatch open along one hinged side.'
p2156
aS'We held our glowsticks underwater near the opening. The hatch opened into an ordinary-looking but flooded room beneath us with a yellow-tiled floor. Chrome and porcelain rippled up at us.'
p2157
aS'We realized after a moment it was a flooded bathroom.\n\n"If this portal thing leads through a toilet," Niko said, "I\'m out."'
p2158
aS'We could only assume the way through was somewhere out of sight, around a corner or down an unseen hall. But how far?'
p2159
aS'"The other guys are probably doing the same thing on their side," Niko said hopefully. "Maybe we\'ll swim through at exactly the same time, go past each other."'
p2160
aS'"You really think we\'re still in sync? After everything that\'s happened? Our doubles defeated their own evil Niko with exactly the same strategy and ended up here at precisely the same time as us?"'
p2161
aS'He shrugged. "Might as well believe that. Because if we don\'t, and, uh, there\'s no way back... that would kind of suck."'
p2162
aS'"We don\'t even know if this goes anywhere," I said. "For all we know, there\'s a mile of flooded tunnel down there before it mirrors back to our world, if it ever does. You know what would suck more? Drowning."'
p2163
aS'"No, look," he said with a grin, thrusting his light deeper into the circular opening. "There\'s a guide rope."'
p2164
aS"I squinted, trying to make the wavering underwater shapes resolve. Tied to something just under the hatchway was a climbing rope, the same kind we'd used with our Grip Monkeys."
p2165
aS'It stretched down in a taut line out of sight, towards the hidden wall of the room beneath us.'
p2166
aS'Niko reached into the hatch to give it a tug; it seemed taut. "Thirty-five meter rope," he said. "And the end\'s cut off, so it\'s got to be shorter than that. Looks like someone marked the way through."'
p2167
aS'He pulled off his shirt and started emptying his pockets.'
p2168
aS'"What are you doing?" I asked, unsettled.'
p2169
aS'"No time like the present," he said. "Might as well get it over with. Come on in, the water\'s fine."'
p2170
aS'Something was wrong again. The dark circle of the submerged porthole was ominous. Unknown. This was happening way too fast. "I don\'t know. Shit. What if something happens down there? What if one of us gets stuck, or needs help?'
p2171
aS'We could fucking _drown_." My mind was racing. It felt like riding a bike that kept slipping gears, nothing quite fitting together, accelerating down a hill with less and less control, no way to stop.'
p2172
aS'"Let\'s just do it," Niko said brightly. "I mean, the sooner we go through, the sooner we\'ll be home."'
p2173
aS'"How did you even know this was here?" My throat tightened. His eyes widened. "No. I can\'t do this again. Why won\'t any of you be honest with me? Stop it. I know. _I know._ You\'re not... you\'re not really..."'
p2174
aS'Somewhere far below us, something _groaned_, low, immense. The ground quivered, like a mountain turning over in its sleep, and the surface of the water pinched and jittered in sympathy.'
p2175
aS'And just as this happened Niko reached up, eyes wide, and touched two fingers to my lips. Made a zipping motion across them. I was shocked into silence by it all: the sound, the absurdity of the gesture, his fingers on my lips.'
p2176
aS'The fear on his face.'
p2177
aS'"Don\'t," he said, quiet. "Please."\n\nWe both took a breath.'
p2178
aS'"You have to trust me, Orion. Everything will work out for us. Everything. But you have to _trust me_, now, here, about this if nothing else."'
p2179
aS'The rumbling receded. The water smoothed out.'
p2180
aS'He took another breath, seemed to notice his fingers were still touching my lips, pulled them back. Stared at them.'
p2181
aS"And as his eyes flicked back to mine I saw something there I'd never seen, no matter how much I'd wanted to. Something hot and desperate, yearning, vulnerable."
p2182
aS'Something that rippled in the space between us, flickered and grew, a mass, almost a shape.\n\nAnd I understood.'
p2183
aS'The finger, lying cold on the carpet inches from my eye, the whorled texture of his fingerprints.'
p2184
aS"_I'll hunt that bitch down, and kill him. Again._"
p2185
aS"How easily he'd found the trapdoor, led us straight here to the way back through. How sure he was about what I'd find on the other side."
p2186
aS"And the way he'd fought for me. The way he'd been looking at me.\n\nHe wasn't my Niko."
p2187
aS'The ground groaned again beneath us, more dangerous this time. A brick fell from somewhere above, made a splash loud enough to make us both flinch. But we didn\'t break eye contact.\n\n"Don\'t say it," he breathed.'
p2188
aS'Synchronicity.'
p2189
aS'I felt like we were balanced on an impossibly heavy pivot, a mountain peak turned upside down. If we leaned too far in any direction...'
p2190
aS'Two soap bubbles, pressed together, floating in a vast empty void. Trembling.'
p2191
aS"Somehow we were closer than we'd been a moment before. The curves of his jaw, his cheek, were aches inside me, blood-memorized, bone-familiar."
p2192
aS'The air around us held its breath. Where the water touched my knees, it thrummed.'
p2193
aS'His lips were too close to mine. It would be so easy.'
p2194
aS'It would last forever, like dying winter sunlight slanting into a room through melting icicles, lighting it up,'
p2195
aS'setting fire to the neurons that had always struggled to keep truths and fictions apart and burning them away forever, every universe fading away like stage lights until the spotlight of that kiss would be the only thing left.'
p2196
aS'What I\'d always wanted made real, at last.\n\n"I want to," I breathed.'
p2197
aS'"Then do it." The need in his eyes was almost too bright to bear.'
p2198
aS'I shook my head. "Not that. I want to trust you."'
p2199
aS'He blinked. "Then do that." But I pulled back, biting my lip, and his brow creased with worry. "Can\'t you?"'
p2200
aS'I wanted to laugh. _Trust?_ Could we _trust_ each other? The question unraveled into a million strands, tendrils stretching back through everything that had happened down here, and everything that had happened before that. Trust.'
p2201
aS'What a beautiful, fucked-up, irrational concept.\n\nHe kept his gaze locked on mine.'
p2202
aS"I tried to see him. Really see him. I willed the layers of muck and confusion between us to pull back, to clear away and reveal someone, at last, who I could understand. The Niko who forgave me. The Niko I'd hurt."
p2203
aS"The Nikos I'd saved, damned, slept with; the ones who needed me, who hated me, who wanted me dead. The one I'd tried so hard to find, looked everywhere for, down here, up there, inside us both and beyond possibility."
p2204
aS'Each of them were tales disguised as truths; worlds that I yearned to slip into like tailored gloves, sized just right;'
p2205
aS'stories reassuring me that I finally understood what I deserved, good or bad, where I belonged and who I belonged to, and who belonged to me,'
p2206
aS"where I didn't have to be alone in a dark bedroom any more with no one who loved me to tuck me in, too afraid to fall asleep."
p2207
aS"But people don't wrap up like that into nice little cages, contained. We weren't each others' stories. He wasn't the Niko I wanted. None of them had been, even if this one thought maybe he could be, was as deluded as I'd been."
p2208
aS"We'd mistaken shadows for substance, all of us: chased them and failed, of course, to grab them, become shadows ourselves in failing."
p2209
aS"But we weren't shadows. We were more than that. We deserved more."
p2210
aS"Something swayed inside me, as if I'd let go of one handhold and gripped another, shifting my weight even though I wasn't sure the new grip would hold. But by then I'd already done it, already committed. And it held. It didn't let me fall."
p2211
aS'"I\'m going through." I took a deep breath. "But it\'s not because I trust you." He looked alarmed but I raised a hand. "It\'s okay. Let me finish. I don\'t deserve your trust, and maybe I don\'t know how to give it to anyone else.'
p2212
aS'But if I have to start somewhere I should start with myself. And I think I can do this. I _trust_ I can. Okay? I made Tiger Shark in swim club and I can hold my breath for three minutes and I can make it. I can make it through. I can.'
p2213
aS'But Niko, you can\'t come with me." Tears sprung like pinpricks to my eyes, but I blinked them back, fierce. "You _can\'t come with me_."'
p2214
aS'"Bullshit," he said, stepping forward, even though I could see he knew I was right, see it in how his faced creased with pain. "I belong with you. Your double, on the other side..."'
p2215
aS'An ominous crack sounded from somewhere above us, but he pressed on. "He doesn\'t feel the same way about me. I don\'t _belong_ with him."'
p2216
aS'The ground dropped out from under us, like a plane hitting turbulence. Rumbles quivered in stone far below.'
p2217
aS'"Niko, stop," I said, afraid to look away, to even glance at the walls around us, as if they could read the truth in our eyes. "You can\'t come through. You know why you can\'t."'
p2218
aS'"I can live with pain," he said, reaching out for me; but I must have looked shocked, because his expression changed to placating alarm. "No, it\'s okay. They\'re just headaches. The pain doesn\'t matter. It\'d be worth it. You\'re worth it."'
p2219
aS'"I\'m not." I shook my head, angry, never more certain of anything. "You think I could live with myself, putting you through pain like that each day?"'
p2220
aS'"Everything will be all right," he pleaded, ignoring me. "It\'ll be fine, it\'ll all be fine, just let me come through. Let me try. _Let me try._"'
p2221
aS"And I couldn't bear to see that need in his face, reflected back at last after all this time, and wondered if he'd seen it too,"
p2222
aS"how sad and jagged and pathetic and painful it was, and how the way I'd hidden it for so long had only made it more of all those things,"
p2223
aS"and I couldn't stand hurting him anymore, and then the words came that we should have said to each other long before,"
p2224
aS'not that any words could fill the gaps inside us but these were the ones I had and they were better than nothing, so I said them: "I\'m not the only one who can love you."'
p2225
aS'He stopped dead, face draining of color.'
p2226
aS'The surface of the water twitched, rippled. Waiting.'
p2227
aS"I took a long, ragged breath and realized what I'd said was true. And not just for him."
p2228
aS"He broke our gaze. His eyes fell to the water beneath us like he'd dropped something, watched resigned as it sunk away for good, no longer trying to save it."
p2229
aS'"Guess, from your perspective," he said carefully, "that should have been my line."'
p2230
aS'"Yeah, well." I waved my hand at the architecture around us. "Life\'s got a funny way of fucking everything up."'
p2231
aS"He laughed, sudden and loud, and even if things weren't right, even if the edge between us was jagged and always would be, it was good to hear that laugh again."
p2232
aS'We breathed. It was settled.'
p2233
aS'"So," he said. "You\'ll swim through. Pass your other." He swallowed; I nodded. _Just my other. Not his._ "And then we\'ll each be where we should be." His face hardened into a mask as he said this, grim and colorless.'
p2234
aS'Then he looked at me, the corner of his mouth twisting in pain but also a challenge, flinging some of the pain back: "You\'ll be fine without me, I guess. Yeah?"'
p2235
aS'It did hurt, like he knew it would. Well. At least we were saying truths to each other. Not quite the same as trust, but a good start.'
p2236
aS"I stripped down to my jeans, self-conscious, but Niko was spinning a theory about the identical set of clothes I'd find on the other side."
p2237
aS"If alter-me was swimming through too, he should have had this same thought, and we'd both have dry shirts and shoes waiting, and wasn't that cool?"
p2238
aS"I wasn't really processing this, still overwhelmed. Trust. Pairs of universes, pulling apart. Drowning, death. Dry clothes seemed like insubstantial details."
p2239
aS'I tied the glow stick to my belt loop, emptied my pockets of everything non-essential.'
p2240
aS'"Oh hey," he said as I did this, affecting it as a casual afterthought, "I want you to take something through for me." He pulled a plastic bag from his pocket, folded-up pages with something written on them inside.'
p2241
aS'"Hold onto it for a while, okay? Just till you get back through."'
p2242
aS'"Sure." I took the bag. "I suppose I shouldn\'t read it until---?" A faint judder rippled through the ground; for an instant the water danced in interference patterns.'
p2243
aS'He looked pained. "Please, please don\'t." Glancing around, he took a deep breath. "Okay. You ready?"\n\nI wasn\'t, so I stepped forward and hugged him, fierce as the roiling lump in my throat.'
p2244
aS'His bare skin, still damp, felt hot against my own. He held me tight, wet curls rubbing against my face. Heat passed between us, but it was the least of what had.'
p2245
aS"We'd loved each other, at times. Even if the people we'd loved were mostly in our heads."
p2246
aS'It was nice, but his curls were tickling my nose, and I pulled back before I meant to, reflecting his surprise at this with embarrassment.'
p2247
aS'For a second it looked like he thought I was going to kiss him, and then I thought maybe he was thinking of kissing me, and we both stood uncertain for a second or two before dropping arms and stepping back.'
p2248
aS'Awkward. But sort of perfect for the mismatched shape of us, which was, if nothing else, our own.\n\n"Are you going to be okay?" he asked, without spite this time.'
p2249
aS"I didn't know how to answer, because despite these tidy revelations, the thought of never seeing him again still stabbed at something deep inside me, and maybe always would;"
p2250
aS'and the idea that anyone in this or any world would ever know me as well as he did seemed impossible.'
p2251
aS'But I nodded. Eventually, maybe, it would be true.\n\n"How about you?"'
p2252
aS'He grinned. "I don\'t plan to spend a couple decades sulking down here like that asshole, if that\'s what you mean." He looked up at the arched roof above us, scanning the bricks like there might be constellations in them.'
p2253
aS'"I\'ve never known what I wanted, man. Just what everybody else wants me to want. I\'m sorry I mixed you up in all that." He shrugged. "Guess I should figure that out, yeah? Spend some time with myself. Maybe more solo camping, you know?'
p2254
aS'Wandering in the wilderness. Worked for Jesus."'
p2255
aS'"Sure," I said. "You see that wolf again up there, man... you fucking wreck it."'
p2256
aS'We grinned at each other, one last time, or maybe for the first time, depending on how you looked at it: and then I turned away, toward the submerged portal, the way out, the way home. I stared down at it.'
p2257
aS'The thought of swimming into that hole without knowing the way to the other side stabbed a different part of me, the one concerned with oxygen and continued existence.'
p2258
aS'I pushed the fear down but it kept manufacturing images for me: jeans snagging on hidden nails that held me back while I flailed uselessly;'
p2259
aS'huge dead fish swimming the flooded halls with flaking gray skin, bulging eyes growing larger and larger as they closed on me.'
p2260
aS'I imagined drowning. Breathing water instead of air. Spasms of lungs. Knowing you were about to die, only not soon enough. Not nearly soon enough.'
p2261
aS"I took a deep breath, then another. I tried to slow my heartbeat. I didn't look at Niko."
p2262
aS'Another breath. _Breathe._ Deeper and deeper.'
p2263
aS"I stared at the circular opening, visualized the motions I'd make. I tried to believe I could do this. I tried to push down the sliver of doubt lodged somewhere in my throat."
p2264
aS"Gripping the sides of the hatch, I paused. I wasn't ready. But if I waited any longer, I'd never be."
p2265
aS'"Later, skater," I said, not looking back, then took one last huge breath and dove headfirst into the hatch.'
p2266
aS'Chapter 17\n\nThe room below was, in fact, a bathroom, lined with tile that might have been a pale yellow but glowed red in the light of my glowstick. Chromium sink fixtures and a frosted-glass shower threw back fiery light.'
p2267
aS'In contrast to the other flooded chambers there was no mold, no algae, no water damage. It might have been flooded seconds before.'
p2268
aS"I didn't pause to wonder about this, but kicked off through the open door into a murky hall, following the guide rope which led onwards like Niko had said."
p2269
aS'I focused on my strokes, old swimming lessons coming back. This was a different sort of lane, of course: the floor brown carpet, plaster-of-paris above instead of a shimmering boundary of air.'
p2270
aS"And the wounded leg slowed me down: it hurt, every time I kicked. But I wasn't worried, not yet. I had good lungs. I could swim for a while."
p2271
aS'The rope turned a corner into a large unfurnished room with a half-dozen washers and dryers piled in a corner. I swam past them, mechanical, calm, following the rope through an open doorway opposite.'
p2272
aS'Through the door was what looked like a small porch or mud room. Boots and shoes tumbled weightless in the water. The rope stopped here, tied to a capped metal pipe. The opposite wall was a sliding glass patio door.\n\nThe airlock.'
p2273
aS"Through the glass it was dark. All I could see was my own red reflection holding the glowstick. Seeing myself floating there, a hit of adrenaline coursed through me. How much air was left in my lungs? More than half what I'd started with?"
p2274
aS"Doubt flooded into me. _This is crazy. I can't do this._ I forced the thought from my mind, replaced it with: _Just hurry. Hurry and get it over with._"
p2275
aS'I slid the glass door open and forced myself into the black water beyond. The ground dropped off on the other side, and there was no ceiling, either. Everything was dark.\n\nAnd as I swam past the threshold something _changed_.'
p2276
aS'The water cooled; the pressure and ambient sound in my ears shifted.'
p2277
aS'I could see the vague outlines of another sliding door just ahead of me, but it seemed too as if I floated in a cavernous space, a space beyond measuring, the other door impossibly distant.'
p2278
aS"Disoriented, I turned around to shut the one I'd come through---remembering they couldn't both be open at once---and as I did another shock of _change_ swept through me, crystallizing into something immense, yawning, terrorful."
p2279
aS'I remembered the spring Elder Niko had spoken of\n\n pools as clear as air\n\ndeep at the roots of this place: a spring that split and split and split again, endless.'
p2280
aS'I felt possibilities branching in the water around me, but even more in the waters inside me, in the part of me inside the waters.'
p2281
aS'Branching, expanding, growing like mold in a petri dish but spilling out of the dish now, spreading through the lab into the walls, the world\n\n down in cool places\n\nand it was as if I was the mold,'
p2282
aS'the spring, an effervescent source spilling out into infinite variation, branches branching and branched again into an unfillable space, filling it.'
p2283
aS'Boundless, multiplied. Multiplicious.'
p2284
aS'Slowed by dream-syrup, fighting awed stupor from these whispers of immensity, I turned my back on that powerful water at the center, pulled the glass door shut, staring numb as it slid implacable down its track.'
p2285
aS'In the last second before the door clicked shut and my glowstick guttered out, I saw something reflected in the glass. There were people floating behind me.'
p2286
aS'They drifted in that immense and empty space, lit a gangrenous red by the light of my glowstick. Three of them. All with my body, my clothes. My face.'
p2287
aS'Their wide-open eyes (_my_ eyes) were fixed on me as they floated gently forward, converging.\n\nTheir grasping hands reached out for me, and then the door clicked shut, and everything went black.'
p2288
aS"I screamed, bubbles of precious oxygen exploding from my mouth. I yanked the handle of the door, but it wouldn't budge. I clawed at it, slammed my fist against the glass."
p2289
aS'The darkness was absolute, thickened by the potent water into a solid, crushing thing.'
p2290
aS"The door wouldn't open and they were right behind me they were coming they were going to get me and\n\nI twisted\n\nwildly, pressed hands to the glass behind me, trying to guess their position, but it was hopeless. I couldn't see."
p2291
aS"I'd squandered my air. Hands would close around my neck, my face, and I'd scream again one last time and drown, thrashing in pain and terror and darkness. Alone.\n\n_No._"
p2292
aS"Anger pierced through fear. Maybe I had issues and maybe I'd made mistakes, and maybe I even deserved this, to be strangled by my own soulless doppelgangers in a shitty basement apartment with delusions of grandeur."
p2293
aS"But I didn't want to die, and being alone had nothing to do with it."
p2294
aS"I wasn't going to let this happen to me just because dad would never be back to tuck me in, just because I'd never hear Niko's laugh again and he wouldn't be there next time to save my ass. None of that mattered. I was still here."
p2295
aS'I was still alive.\n\nFor now.'
p2296
aS"_Think._\n\nThey'd been coming from three angles, two above and one below."
p2297
aS"In the middle there'd been a gap.\n\nGripping my panic by the neck before it ran wild, snarling like a cornered animal, I put my feet against the glass door behind me and pushed off hard, as hard as I could."
p2298
aS'The pain in my wounded calf went white-hot but I barely noticed it. I shot straight forward, intent, threading the gap like a needle, right through the center of the things closing in.\n\nI hoped.'
p2299
aS'Something brushed my leg. I kicked forward, pulled water with cupped hands and all the strength I had. Two fingertips bounced off my forehead, trailed through my hair, but I was moving too fast for them, I was through, I was past them.'
p2300
aS"I'd done it."
p2301
aS'I surged forward, swimming hard, a savage rictus of victory splitting my face, and then with a crunch and flash of pain I slammed face-first into something hard and smooth. Glass. The door on the opposite side.'
p2302
aS"Seeing stars, tasting blood, I scrabbled for the handle, but I couldn't find it. My hands slid off smooth glass in every direction."
p2303
aS'I smeared them across it frantically, up, down, side to side, kicking out with my feet, conscious every second of those things behind me, turning, drifting back towards me, closing in; of the air in my lungs, running low. Running out.'
p2304
aS'There: the handle. I pulled it sideways, and as the door slid open in its groove my glowstick came back on, the most glorious shade of red you could possibly imagine.'
p2305
aS"I kicked forward into the other anteroom and pulled the door shut behind me, not looking back. There was no sign of the things, the Lookie-Loos, the echoes, whatever they were. I'd escaped them."
p2306
aS'My face throbbed with a sharp, spreading pain. But I had a bigger problem. In fact with lightheaded desperation I realized I was in deep, deep shit.'
p2307
aS"My air was almost gone. I'd lost some panicking, and my muscles burned through the rest as I shot myself through the airlock. An urge to breathe was taking hold of me, a tingling thrum running through my body as cells clamored for air."
p2308
aS"My lungs were empty. I couldn't swim again the distance I'd come, either forward or back."
p2309
aS'Ahead of me, down the mirror-tunnel toward the other hatch and the other junction room, a deep red light burned, brightening. The reflected light from another glowstick.\n\nI watched myself swim into the room, holding it.'
p2310
aS"Amidst all the panicked horror and desperation, I hadn't noticed the wrongness creep up on me, but now I realized that sick feeling had been there all along, getting stronger, flavoring my more pressing concerns."
p2311
aS"This wasn't one of the things, I realized. It was me. My double, from the other side."
p2312
aS"We were passing each other, as planned. But the plan had failed.\n\nWe stared at each other and both realized I wasn't going to make it."
p2313
aS"Blood diffused from my nose in billowing red clouds; the cut on my leg burned a deep, dangerous ache. My torn fingernails stung where I'd clawed at the door. I was damaged, flawed. The worse-off copy."
p2314
aS'Looking at him, unharmed, whole, I accepted that I was about to die. It was surprisingly easy.'
p2315
aS"He tilted his head, studying me. As if considering something. Or trying to see me, really see me, like I'd tried so many times to see Niko."
p2316
aS"_Do it_, I thought, _I'm too broken to make it. Go back. Or go forward. Just go. Live. Be the one who lives._"
p2317
aS'His expression changed. Just a little.'
p2318
aS"And then he launched himself at me. At once the sense of wrongness spiked, as if approaching some exponential maxima. His face winced at this in exact sympathy with mine, but he didn't pull up, slow down."
p2319
aS"Instead he crashed right into me, hard. Tumbling, he wrapped his arms around me, held me, did the last thing I'd have ever expected.\n\nHe pushed his mouth to mine, and flooded my lungs with his air."
p2320
aS'The wrongness had reached an unbearable threshold. But as his lips touched mine the sensation exploded outward, like magnets pushed against repelling poles till they slip from your fingers, flip around, snap into place.'
p2321
aS"The water quivered around us; the room groaned, launching wet clouds of mud from splintering lintels, sending subsonic shockwaves shuddering through us. His breath flowed into me. I couldn't think, let alone protest or react."
p2322
aS'Boots tumbled around us, long laces waving like antennae. I remember that.\n\nAnd then he was empty, and I was full.'
p2323
aS"He pulled back, blinked, smiled a smile I knew from the mirror. It meant _Oh, well, what you gonna do_.\n\nHe'd picked me."
p2324
aS"A huge rumbling crack broke over the growing crescendo of rumbles and groans, and we both looked up. The ceiling had split in a long ugly scar. But the room wasn't collapsing on us."
p2325
aS'The split filled in almost immediately with new plaster, just as a different split bisected it, which also instantly filled.\n\nThe room was getting bigger.'
p2326
aS"My double grabbed my elbow, pushed me toward the hall he'd come in through, the way to the hatch to the other world, my world. And I started to swim. I shouldn't have. I should have thanked him."
p2327
aS"I should have given back half his air, or dragged him after me, found some way to save him. I should have died. But I didn't. I swam. I swam with everything I had left."
p2328
aS"He'd made a mistake. Bet on the wrong horse. But I wouldn't forget it. I wouldn't forget him."
p2329
aS'All around me the architecture was groaning, flexing, like something waking up.'
p2330
aS'Plaster dust pillowed into the flooded hall in thick weightless clouds as the walls split and reformed, split and reformed, like bones breaking and healing and rebreaking, growing fractionally longer each time.'
p2331
aS"I swam past a crack that didn't fill in but puckered into a new doorway, a flap of wallpaper lengthening and hardening into door. New doorways were spawning all around me; new pits gaped open in the floor. I ignored it all. I swam."
p2332
aS'I swam for my fucking life.'
p2333
aS"The guide rope, taut as a bowstring, snapped, whipping past my face as its two endpoints pulled away from each other. It didn't matter. I knew the way."
p2334
aS"I swam into the mirror bathroom, shiny new sinks sprouting on the floor, on the ceiling; the toilet multiplying and splitting in porcelain osmosis, someone's pretentious art project."
p2335
aS"I swam up to the ceiling---already much higher than a bathroom ceiling should be---put my hands on the wheel of the hatch, and turned.\n\nIt didn't budge."
p2336
aS"The groaning rumbles of hell surrounded me, my body was once again starting to tingle as my second lungful of air reached its end, my face throbbed and my leg was on fire, and the wheel wouldn't turn."
p2337
aS'I pounded on the hatch, screaming in fury, the sound utterly lost in the cacophonous eruption of architecture beneath me.\n\nI braced myself, gripped the wheel so hard I thought my knuckles would pop, pulled on it with everything I had.'
p2338
aS'Then I tried turning it the other direction, and the wheel spun.'
p2339
aS'I yanked it around, then forced myself up against the hatch, lungs burning, kicking hard, and pushed and swung it up and open, and then I was through, breaking the surface. I breathed, huge and deep.'
p2340
aS'Then I coughed. Clutching the sides of the hatch, I coughed, blinked, tried to take stock of this new hexagonal room. A huge crack had opened in the floor, and all the water had drained out.'
p2341
aS'The groaning and clanging was sharper up here, out of the water, but mostly coming from beneath.'
p2342
aS'I pulled myself out of the raised pillar and tumbled to the bucking ground, wiped blood from my face. I was gasping, coughing, bleeding, hurting, panicking, and also, somehow, living. Deservedly or not.'
p2343
aS'Piled on the lip of one of the tunnels out were a pair of shoes and a dry, folded t-shirt.'
p2344
aS'An ear-splitting crack rang off the walls. Bricks fell from the ceiling in a deadly shower, landing a dozen feet away. I grabbed the shirt and pulled it on over my wet torso, slipped the shoes over numb and wrinkled feet.'
p2345
aS'The ground heaved beneath me like the back of a whale taking a colossal breath before diving deep, and as it did it swallowed up the bricks,'
p2346
aS"incorporated them neatly into itself like a child's plastic puzzle pieces falling into matching slots."
p2347
aS'The floor of the bathroom, through the open hatch, was gone. Tile walls descended, vanishing into darkness.'
p2348
aS'They were splitting and rejoining, like some fractal screensaver, an optical illusion in constant motion from the corner of your eye but damnably still if you looked right at it.'
p2349
aS"Something was broken. Something had diverged too far. There were too many possibilities and they couldn't all fit. They needed more room.\n\nTime, I decided, to get the hell out."
p2350
aS'With a great belching snap, the floor punctured upwards and a spout of cloudy water billowed up. Another spout exploded from the other side of the room.'
p2351
aS'I picked one of the circular tunnels and started running down it, as fast as I could on my hobbled leg, while behind me the depths of Downstairs sloughed and squirmed into new permutations, unseen. I was too busy living to look back.'
p2352
aS'EPILOGUE\n\nFrom W. B.'
p2353
aS'Yeats:\n\n"When you are old and grey and full of sleep,\nAnd nodding by the fire, take down this book,\nAnd slowly read,'
p2354
aS'and dream of the soft look\nYour eyes had once, and of their shadows deep"\n\nI hope this finds you well, if it finds you at all.'
p2355
aS'I walked by our old house this morning. The whole yard was flooded, caution tape everywhere. Empty driveway. Whoever lives there now must have abandoned ship while they waited for the plumbers to sort it all out. But it gave me an idea.'
p2356
aS"I always wondered what you must have felt, waiting on the other side for your Ryan to come through, imperfect though you knew he'd be: waiting while the whole place started to shiver and crumble and expand around you."
p2357
aS"Maybe you thought we both died down there. Maybe you did too but I don't think so. I bet you were smart enough to run."
p2358
aS"I hope you found another way back up to the surface, like I did. Took some doing. There were no more power bars by the time I made it out and hadn't been for a while. But I did make it out, in the end."
p2359
aS"Maybe it would be better to let you keep thinking I'm dead. Maybe I shouldn't be writing this. But I think you'd rather know. There's a difference between dead and gone, despite the expression."
p2360
aS"I think you'd prefer knowing one Ryan, at least, survived. I never really did understand how you think, but I'm reasonably sure about that."
p2361
aS"Water gushing up from the basement windows. A mess. But I found a little whirlpool in the swamp of the front yard, a big exposed pipe sucking liquid back in. Back down. That's where I'll drop this, I suppose."
p2362
aS"Maybe that pipe just leads to the city sewer system, but maybe, if I'm lucky, it goes a lot deeper.\n\nI'll triple-bag the shit out of this first, though, because, and I hate to say this, the letter you gave me didn't survive my swim through."
p2363
aS'The seal on that baggie must not have been tight. When I finally pulled it out, back on the surface, the letter was soaked through and mostly illegible. Something seemed to have expanded it, too.'
p2364
aS'All that was left was a nightmare of bloated wood pulp and smeared squiggles. Too much of both. But after a lot of tweezer work, I pieced together a little. Not the whole story, but enough to maybe get the gist.'
p2365
aS"We were wrong, weren't we? About you guys being trapped on the wrong side, like us. Sure, you were trapped just like we were when the fridge connection was broken."
p2366
aS"But we were wrong when we thought you'd been looking for a way to get back through. Because you were back already, where you belonged, on your own side. The problem was that two doppelgangers had followed you through.\n\nUs."
p2367
aS'You figured it out a lot quicker than we did, I think. How that loss of synchronicity had pulled our twin houses partially apart, like a gardener starting to separate two potted flowers. How the easy way back had been sheared off.'
p2368
aS'So you had to figure out a different way to get rid of us. We were sleeping in your beds. Eating your food. Stealing your lives while you lurked below, afraid to come near us and push things even farther out of sync.'
p2369
aS'Sneaking up to steal food in the middle of the night, thieves in your own house. And the only way to send us back was to find another connection point, a deeper one, down where roots still twined together. And prod us into finding it, too.'
p2370
aS'You had a lot more time to explore than we did. Downstairs became your home.'
p2371
aS"You couldn't explain things to us, not directly. Because if we'd also realized how much things had diverged, it would have tugged our universes even further apart. So you tried to find the subtlest ways to send a message."
p2372
aS'Saying things without changing hardly anything. Tweaking the note, the video. Pulling us back from the dead-end of the crawlways. Nudging us away from the red herrings closer to the surface, to deeper explorations.'
p2373
aS"Toward the new way through you'd discovered. A flooded tunnel, buried deep. A way to get us back home."
p2374
aS"I think about that a lot. We were your monsters. But you helped us anyway. Maybe you didn't see any other choice, but still. That was pretty great of you."
p2375
aS'A lot of your note was illegible, and like I said, there seemed to be way too many pages, and a lot of duplicates. But toward the end I could piece together a few phrases, and I think I figured out some of how your story ended.'
p2376
aS"Once you'd found the flooded connection, you could pass through to our home universe, and help clear the way back for us. Leave guide ropes. Make it easy."
p2377
aS'One of you stayed to keep an eye on us, to make sure we "discovered" the flooded tunnel.'
p2378
aS"Once we did, the plan was probably that you'd swim back through in advance, so that, when the time came, all four of us could pass each other, and the two of us could keep holding onto the thread of belief that synchronicity wasn't broken."
p2379
aS'At least until we were all in the right place again and what we believed no longer mattered.'
p2380
aS"But then that other Niko crept up from the depths of possibility and fucked everything up. You didn't see that coming, I don't think. How could you have?"
p2381
aS'Bitterness, multiplied. Multiplicious.\n\nDid you find your own body, murdered, mutilated, in one of those bland hallways?'
p2382
aS"I'm so sorry. I can't imagine what that must have been like.\n\nI don't know quite how to tell you this next part."
p2383
aS"Your Ryan never came back because he saved me. He _chose_ to save me. I don't know why. I didn't deserve saving. But he did it anyway."
p2384
aS"You saved me too, of course. On the bedroom tube above that awful void, and other times besides. And I deserved even less to be saved by you, maybe. Maybe you should have let me die. But you didn't. Neither of you did."
p2385
aS'And I can never pay you back for that.'
p2386
aS"I am enclosing ten bucks, though, for the drink you bought me that night at the Russian dance club. I assume your Ryan was as much of a mooch as me. I did say I'd get you back, didn't I?"
p2387
aS'I should wrap this up. If I spend all day writing mysterious letters to another man, my boyfriend might get jealous.'
p2388
aS"Kevin. His name's Kevin."
p2389
aS"Maybe it's ridiculous to think something as tiny as a triple-bagged USB key wrapped in a ten-spot could possibly find its way to you. If our two universes connect at all any more, it's far down in knotted skeins, hopelessly tangled."
p2390
aS'I imagine this baggie winding its way through miles of piping, tumbling down moss-covered tunnels, floating through submerged, warped bedrooms. Somehow making its way back up to another surface, another flood. Seems silly.'
p2391
aS"But I see it in my head, vivid. I try to believe there's a world where it could reach you, even though the odds seem astronomical.\n\nOn the other hand, with so many possibilities down there, maybe it's inevitable."
p2392
aS'Irrational, but true.'
p2393
aS"I haven't dreamt about you in years, but I did last night. Not in particulars. Your name floated through me, troubling in some way but not defined. A word repeated until it loses its meaning, becomes obsessed with itself."
p2394
aS"A reflection's reflection. It's why I came by the old house, but all that was here was a flooded yard. All it reflected was me."
p2395
aS'I never knew what we were to each other back then. Something less than all those things we never were, but more than a friendship. An else-ship, maybe. An other-ship. Traces of mingled shrapnel under shared skin.'
p2396
aS'Broken pieces of each other we tried to make our own.'
p2397
aS"I guess we're left with what we had. _Have._ Definitely have, yeah? Because we're gone to each other, but not dead. We survived."
p2398
aS'So hey. I hope you\'re doing all right in your weird world where people say "fourth" instead of "fourd." I hope you found better people to hang out with and a new set of hobbies and someone to appreciate your fashion sense.'
p2399
aS"I hope you realized you were someone worth saving, too.\n\nI miss you sometimes, but that's okay."
p2400
aS"We made it. And I think... I think we'll be alright."
p2401
aS'Nah. Scratch that.\n\nI trust we will.'
p2402
a.
