S'PART ONE\n\nDOWNSTAIRS\n\nFrom From "Tell the Wolves I\'m Home," by Carol Rifka Brunt:\n\n"Maybe I was destined to forever fall in love with people I couldn\'t have.'
p1
aS'Maybe there\'s a whole assortment of impossible people waiting for me to find them. Waiting to make me feel the same impossibility over and over again."'
p2
aS"I don't know how to tell you this. I never wanted to gut you, reach inside and pull things out, not again. Old wounds and sleeping dogs, you know. Tales better left untold."
p3
aS"And you've already heard this one, even if your version never quite matched mine."
p4
aS"But that's why I'm sitting here, writing this. If it's just a story, you see, maybe we can understand it. You know, come to terms.\n\nPretend it's not ours."
p5
aS"I used to have these dreams, when I was young. Did I ever tell you this? I'd be wandering an endless beach of smooth white sand, unbroken but for a handful of deep and conical pits."
p6
aS"I'd peer into these when I neared one, anxious, feet clenching the loose sand of its lip. Sometimes there'd be a puddle of murky water at the bottom. Sometimes a dark opening. Sometimes teeth."
p7
aS'Even the ones without teeth ached with some invisible wrongness, were more than negative spaces in sand. They had energy, a primal liveness. They were hungry.'
p8
aS"I was fascinated and repelled by them, drawn to their edges again and again, toes curling, though I'd try to stay away."
p9
aS'But they multiplied as I wandered, puncturing the flat sand more and more until they reduced it to a maze of pathways, then one of ridges.'
p10
aS"Inevitably I'd take a wrong step and start to slide, tumbling with the treacherous sand down toward the dark of the bottom, a point just large enough to slip through, to swallow me up."
p11
aS"Almost always I'd wake before I reached it, but once I slid past pit-teeth and they bit me, sliced into my back, and I woke with a shock of pain so intense I screamed."
p12
aS"I'd tumbled out of my bunk bed and fallen onto a half-assembled model; plastic struts had pierced my skin. I got rushed to the hospital in the middle of the night, mom in her dressing gown and me in bloody pajamas, and got ten stitches."
p13
aS"I'd woken up too late. The pit had won."
p14
aS"Maybe premonition, the dreams, but I think something simpler. Even that young I'd found the fears I'd struggle with well into adulthood. Losing control. Facing the unknown."
p15
aS"And knowing that just because something isn't real doesn't mean it can't hurt you. At four years old I told myself a story of teeth and sand traps. It would take the rest of my life to understand why."
p16
aS'So maybe story is a language we can speak, you and I. Find in the telling the truths that matter. Embellish, excise. Revise. Revision.'
p17
aS"Although our story was never just a story. It happened. You still believe that, don't you?"
p18
aS'Fine. Okay. You ready?'
p19
aS'This is what happened when we found some stairs underneath my bed, and decided to go find out where they led.'
p20
aS"Chapter 1\n\nRight from the start things were wrong, but I couldn't see it. Maybe I didn't want to. Or maybe I'm being too hard on myself. There wasn't exactly a roadmap for what happened, a script to follow."
p21
aS"But it's undeniable that even on that very first night---the night of the Russian dance club, remember?---everything was already wrong."
p22
aS'I was on the back porch, looking over the dying backyard grass at the sunset reddening the top of college hill.'
p23
aS"We'd moved in a few weeks back, Niko and I and our friends, mostly his, students and lapsed students and a few brave graduates, still settling into the rambling old off-campus house we'd found in the newspaper."
p24
aS"(Cast your mind back to a time when kids like us had figured out the internet but people old enough to own property hadn't, so instead of browsing classifieds our bandwidth went entirely to downloading all the music in the world.)"
p25
aS"My Bio homework was in my lap but I couldn't remember what page the reading started on, or why I cared. All I could think about was whether the words I'd said that morning had cost me my best friend."
p26
aS"So when I heard him force his way into the house through the juddering side door, perpetually stuck, I stiffened. He'd stormed out after the argument and I hadn't heard from him since."
p27
aS"I hadn't even started to work through my feelings about it, what I'd said and what I hadn't. I didn't know what to say to him now. Which one of us needed to apologize, or for what."
p28
aS"I tensed, waiting to hear if he'd head upstairs to his room or find me out here, not sure which I wanted. The possibility seemed suspended, unresolved, for an uncomfortably long time."
p29
aS"The screen door creaked and Niko stepped out onto the porch. I didn't turn around. He walked over and stood at the railing next to me, an unlit cigarette between his lips, facing the twilight."
p30
aS'He sucked on the cigarette for a long minute ineffectually, distracted, then slipped it back into his pocket. Gripped the railing.'
p31
aS'"Hey," he finally said, "wanted to invite you out. With a bunch of us," he added, a bit too smooth. "There\'s this new dance club over by the old stadium.'
p32
aS'Supposedly they play this fucking feral, crotch-pummeling Russian dance music and lots of sexy people will be there tonight, including us."'
p33
aS'"Huh." I blinked, not quite getting what this was. "Not really my thing."'
p34
aS'"I mean in a weird way it kind of might be? I mean you like Shostakovitch, right? He\'s Russian. And isn\'t techno sort of the people\'s music of the modern day? Simple, rhythmic, obnoxiously loud?"'
p35
aS'He was reaching. It was kind of sweet but I still felt sullen. "Is this you apologizing?"'
p36
aS'He let out a breath, deflating. "I don\'t know what you want from me, man. After everything we\'ve been through together, you think we\'d be past this kind of shit."'
p37
aS"I couldn't think of what to say. I realized I was being unfair but I also felt terrible unresolved wounds between us. The things I'd said that morning hadn't stopped being true. _You're smothering me. I can't always be there for you."
p38
aS"Sometimes you're too much._"
p39
aS"_Sometimes, I feel like I can't escape you._ I hadn't said that last one."
p40
aS'But. I also hated to feel estranged from him. I wanted everything back the way it was before. More than anything.\n\nWe let the twilight happen to us for another couple minutes.'
p41
aS'"It is me apologizing," he said at last. "You\'re my best friend, Ryan. I can\'t stand to have you angry at me. I need you to---" He stopped, face reddening, scuffed his feet on the deck. "I mean I\'d like to have you around."'
p42
aS"He pulled the cigarette out again, had it to his lips before realizing the lighter he'd thrown out a week ago still wasn't in his pocket. He sighed and dropped it onto the lawn."
p43
aS'"So come out to the club," he said. "We can hate Russian techno together. I\'ll buy the drinks. Let\'s go have a good time. Yeah?"'
p44
aS'"I\'ve got Bio homework." I looked down at the still-closed textbook in my lap, face reddening. "And I don\'t want to be around a lot of loud drunk people tonight. Or loud drunk music."'
p45
aS'"It won\'t be any fun if you aren\'t there," he said quietly.'
p46
aS"I looked up and met his glance, excepting the vulnerability I'd only seen there a handful of times, but found something else."
p47
aS"The half-grin and cocked eyebrow that said he wasn't taking no for an answer, and maybe it said something else, or I wanted to pretend it did. His eyes were so fucking sharp. When they looked at you and wanted something, it hurt."
p48
aS'I sighed. "I\'m going to hate it."'
p49
aS'"Yeah you are." He grinned wickedly. "Every second. We\'re leaving at eight. I\'ll knock on your door." He clapped me on the shoulder. "Who knows.'
p50
aS'Maybe some drunk straight guy will start making out with you cause Russian techno makes him feel all experimental and shit."\n\n"That\'ll definitely happen."'
p51
aS'"What was the point of coming out," he said, already on his way back inside, "if you never actually _go out_?"'
p52
aS'He mimed dropping a mic and his head exploding, and was gone, leaving only the him-shaped hole that always lingered after the rest of him had vanished.'
p53
aS"I was somehow committed. I was going, like he'd wanted. On the off-chance that something interesting would happen."
p54
aS'Something did. But not till much later, when we got back home, drunk and exhausted.'
p55
aS"* * *\n\nWe'd been friends since freshman year of college and best friends since the year after that, and by now felt like something more, placidly absorbing jokes about being joined at the hip, going everywhere together. We were; we did."
p56
aS"Especially since his accident, we'd had a profound if unspoken level of companionship I'd never felt with anyone. Usually I was content with that."
p57
aS"In some ways we had so little in common it was astonishing we'd become friends, and that led to frequent arguments, sometimes rising to breakup levels of drama. At other moments it seemed like the universe had meant us to find each other."
p58
aS"Over the years we'd grown together, like two plants in the same small pot."
p59
aS'It had been an especially tumultuous gauntlet of an undergrad---although I guess it feels that way for everyone---so shared roots twined us together now,'
p60
aS'half-remembered fragments of stories and selves: skipping a funeral to camp together in the rocky canyons of Brushwillow, sharing long silences amidst the lakes and pines;'
p61
aS'pulling all-nighters on mad projects with desperate stakes;'
p62
aS'driving to the next town over through a summer midnight, windows rolled down and air thrumming through,'
p63
aS'desperate to find fresh vegetables for reasons that seemed incredibly important at the time, buzzed from both caffeine and alcohol as in so many stories involving Niko.'
p64
aS'In our defense the alcohol was supposed to go in the ragu.'
p65
aS'I\'d hated the club, as predicted. The music was so loud it hurt, almost as much as it hurt to call the shit they were blasting "music."'
p66
aS"I'd worn my rainbow pride bracelet, the one I'd bought a few months ago and mostly been too chickenshit to wear (it was a college town but a conservative state). I might as well have worn a bag over my head."
p67
aS'Everyone ignored me, including the hypothetical hot guys with loosened inhibitions.'
p68
aS'I stood against a wall hating myself and hating how I must have looked to everyone, an acne-faced geek in too-small clothes lurking on the outskirts, wishing he was back home listening to Dvo\xc5\x99\xc3\xa1k symphonies.'
p69
aS"I drank too much, as usual, and as usual it didn't help. I watched Niko dance his ass off, mostly with girls, and once or twice with guys, whether out of politeness or genuine interest I couldn't tell. I'd never really been able to tell."
p70
aS'He flirted with everyone, flashed the same manic energy in all directions. But he, too, seemed to fail at making any solid human connections, and I was relieved when he cornered me and asked if I wanted to duck out early.'
p71
aS'Walking back home from the club through the chill night air with him was a relief, and not only because the shots were starting to hit me and walking a straight line on my own would have been rough.'
p72
aS'The night felt endless, anonymous, an escape from daytime problems; the argument that morning already a long-forgotten memory, ancient history.'
p73
aS"In the fall we'd be starting our fifth year of college, neither of us particularly close to graduating with any particular degree, and for the first time that felt ominous. The future staked out before us our whole lives was running out."
p74
aS'A blank canvas ought to have been exciting, but any direction we could imagine to go in seemed blocked off, already closed, inaccessible or unrealistic.'
p75
aS'Friends were picking already between the remaining well-flagged routes: getting careers, getting married, getting pregnant, getting gone to new cities, new lives, new starts. It would be our turn soon enough.'
p76
aS'By the time we hit the top of the hill and saw the house, we were ready to be back indoors.'
p77
aS"I'd gotten ranty about real music on the walk back, and as we stepped through the juddering screen door, its metal-on-wood screech already a familiar sound, I had a half-dozen songs queued up to play for him."
p78
aS"Mentally, I mean: digital music players hadn't caught on yet back then, although it was still tragically too late for my records to be anything but anachronism. Vinyl wouldn't start making a comeback for years and was deader than dead."
p79
aS'Maybe that was why I liked it.'
p80
aS"When we moved in I'd stacked my crates of LPs in the closet, so now as we tromped up the stairs to my room and dragged them out to hunt for the albums I wanted to play, we got drunkenly annoyed at the lack of anywhere to put them."
p81
aS'So that was how I ended up on my hands and knees, searching for a way to open up my bed.'
p82
aS'"Bed" was generous: it was a mattress, thrown on a raised wooden platform built into a corner of the room.'
p83
aS'The platform was mattress-sized and had therefore seemed like the sensible spot to put one, but the bulky thing also really seemed like it ought to be hollow and have some storage space inside.'
p84
aS"I'd never found any handles or hinges, but in our drink-addled haze it seemed ridiculous that the thing couldn't be opened somehow, and because I can't leave well enough alone and because unsolved challenges annoy me,"
p85
aS'and, okay, because booze, there I was on hands and knees fiddling with the paneled edges of the platform, shoving and kneading and banging on them.'
p86
aS'When something finally gave with a satisfying _chunk_, I whooped in satisfaction;'
p87
aS'but leapt back startled when the whole platform groaned and swung up, pencils and organic chemistry textbooks sliding off the mattress onto the pitted hardwood floor.'
p88
aS'Underneath was a set of steep stairs down.\n\n"Whoah," Niko said, "Jackpot."'
p89
aS'They were carpeted in the same dark beige as the rest of the house, which looked like someone had redecorated in the seventies and died decades later unaware style had moved on.'
p90
aS'Eleven steps led down to a landing where they twisted right and reversed. Cramped, but bland and familiar: the walls paneled in that same fake wood as the rest of the house, lit by those same tacky wall sconces.'
p91
aS"All as you'd expect from the stairs down to a basement, except we were on the second story and the house already had a basement, which emphatically did not connect through my bed."
p92
aS'Niko laughed in astonishment. "What the fuck is this, man? What\'s down there?"'
p93
aS'"Hell if I know. More secrets." We were grinning, because this sort of thing had already happened a few times since we\'d moved in. The house had been my find.'
p94
aS'The group of us were getting older (or so we thought then) and were looking to move up in the world, so we pooled our resources to go in on a house in the pleasant tree-lined neighborhood a few blocks farther out.'
p95
aS'It was an old house, but big, in good repair, and, most important, cheap: we were all paying less rent than when living in pairs or alone.'
p96
aS'I\'d claimed the funky second-floor patio room in a lumpy wing extending into the backyard, clearly a later addition, and Niko snagged a creaking and stuffy room next to mine which he dubbed "lovingly misshapen."'
p97
aS'A lot of the place was like that: a half-landing here, an awkward angle there, bits taken out and bricked over on some whim or other. The house had expanded and contracted over the generations, it seemed, in decades-long breaths.'
p98
aS"The listing hadn't mentioned a secret passage."
p99
aS"But it also hadn't mentioned the closet with a door in the back leading to a dusty, forgotten room (which now housed a dusty, forgotten game of Axis and Allies);"
p100
aS'nor had it mentioned the extra bedroom in the basement tucked away around a corner and behind an unlikely-looking door.'
p101
aS'These small discoveries gave the place a quirky, rambling feel, and I loved it.'
p102
aS"My whole life I'd had dreams about finding new rooms in houses I'd lived in, each time with a thrill of discovery, of learning your cozy domain still had surprises, things left to find."
p103
aS'Maybe it came from moving around all the time as a kid. Or maybe it said something about me.'
p104
aS"I still had them, the dreams. I didn't know they were about to get much worse."
p105
aS'Niko touched the angled bottom of the bed platform and looked at me, as if for permission. He gestured grandly downwards. "Well, Orion, should we check it out?"'
p106
aS'I gave him a formal bow, the room only spinning a little. "Indeed, Nikolaos, let\'s fucking do it."'
p107
aS'He grinned and tousled my hair, bounding over the lip. He stooped as he took the first few steps, black curls brushing the underside of the tilted platform.'
p108
aS'"You going to fit down there?" I smirked. "This looks made for normal-sized people, not basketball players."'
p109
aS'"High school power-forward Nick appreciates your validation of his identity, thanks," he called back, almost to the landing. "College dilettante Niko, though, wants to know if you\'re fucking coming."'
p110
aS'I hesitated on the threshold, strangely reluctant.'
p111
aS'He turned from the landing to look back up, arms folded. "I\'m not _that_ tall, am I? I\'ve only got like three inches on you and your---" He flailed a hand up and down at me. "Your demographically average carcass. Stop giving me complexes."'
p112
aS"_Actually you're exactly four and a half inches taller than me. But who's counting._"
p113
aS'He shrugged, continued down the next set of stairs and out of sight. "Later, skater."\n\nI flipped his skinny ass off and followed him down.'
p114
aS'Despite his complaints, Niko was in fact wearing a basketball jersey, but an ironic one from the thrift store, for some hopefully-fictional team called the Reagans.'
p115
aS'He wore a purple blazer over it, which I trust is all I need say about his fashion sense. Somehow, it worked.'
p116
aS"His horrifying ensembles always worked, whereas the clothes I'd buy, new or used, turned ugly, permanently wrinkled, and the wrong size by the time I got them home."
p117
aS'"Dear LiveJournal," I\'d written once in my private, locked LiveJournal account, "I get now that I\'m destined to die alone. You can stop sending me signs."'
p118
aS'I had never shared my LiveJournal account with anyone and never would, which some people had told me was missing the point. Nowadays on social media I do a lot of typing and erasing status messages without posting them.'
p119
aS'Maybe you can relate.'
p120
aS"Anyway. Niko had shrugged his shoes off when we'd gotten to my room, and now his bare feet sunk half an inch into carpet as he tromped down the stairs, which was the detail I noticed."
p121
aS'His feet were hard not to notice: maybe it was all the basketball, or the Greek ancestry, but they were like statuary. Perfect.'
p122
aS"The stairs were steep but otherwise unextraordinary. Around the corner, more of them dropped to a second landing. We stomped down, Niko's drunken excitement leading us on. Past that corner was one more landing and one final run of steps."
p123
aS'They opened into a large, windowless room.'
p124
aS'It was bigger than any other room in the house, maybe thirty feet across by seventy-five or eighty long. It had the same beige carpet and brown wall-paneling, tacky faux-bronze wall-sconces, and a plaster ceiling eight feet up.'
p125
aS'No windows, not even those awful basement ones that fill up with dead leaves and spider webs. No furniture, either. Just the expected bits of floor lint, carpet stains, wall gouges, and other subtle remnants of long occupation.'
p126
aS'A cool, musty smell suggested said occupation had been a long time ago.\n\nFive open doorways led out: two along each long edge, and one on the far wall opposite the stairs.'
p127
aS'"Holy shit, Ry, this is fucking amazing!" Niko\'s eyes lit up as he walked a few paces in. He flexed his bare toes on the ugly carpet. "It\'s like a whole secret underground lair!"'
p128
aS'I felt the same thrill, tempered with hesitation. Did our landlord somehow not know about all this extra space? Was it some kind of forgotten bomb shelter? Niko was already talking about throwing parties down here, where to put couches.'
p129
aS'A secret basement hangout spot.\n\nWe called it Downstairs, big D, without really thinking about it.'
p130
aS"The architecture was making my head spin, though. (Okay: also the beer.) But someone else's bedroom was under mine. I felt an indignant vertigo, and made Niko come resolve this mystery before exploring any farther."
p131
aS'We went back up to my room, then downstairs---regular lower-case downstairs---to reconnoiter.'
p132
aS"There was, in fact, an odd protrusion into the kitchen underneath and to one side of my room, and when we peeked into our absent housemate's bedroom around the corner, a mirroring blocky bulge in there."
p133
aS"So together those two bulges explained the stairs, though not why you'd build a staircase in the middle of a wall like that. But the house was full of those weird angles and edges, so it seemed in character."
p134
aS"We went back Downstairs and peeked into a few of the side hallways. Pretty cramped, but no worse than other god-awful basement apartments I'd seen students living in."
p135
aS'Like some of those, there were no windows anywhere, which made sense: it felt too far down. Rooms opened off the sides of the halls (those cheap particle-board doors, those rattling brass-plated tin doorknobs).'
p136
aS'Some were carpeted and looked like they could be bedrooms; others had bare concrete flooring like a laundry or utility room. They were all empty.'
p137
aS'The hallways branched at the end: we picked one and saw both ways passed more doors before making L-turns, each in opposite directions. Those crappy wall sconces were everywhere, so despite the lack of windows, it was almost too bright.'
p138
aS"They were all lit, and weirdly enough we couldn't find a light switch anywhere."
p139
aS'"Are we, uh, paying for all this electricity?" Niko asked with jittery alarm.'
p140
aS'"We haven\'t gotten our first bill yet." I felt proud for not slurring my speech; witty. "Good thing we\'re splitting eight ways."'
p141
aS'We only explored a little farther, looking into another hallway and seeing that it, too, branched and snaked off, shedding rooms left and right.'
p142
aS'Niko had started down that one, but I stopped, a wave of nausea washing over me, and put a hand against the cold wall.'
p143
aS'He stopped instantly. "You okay?"'
p144
aS'I smiled, embarrassed. "I think, uh. Don\'t want to get too far from a bathroom."'
p145
aS'He eyed me appraisingly. "You shouldn\'t have done that last shot. I keep telling you. Beer before liquor, never sicker." He tousled my hair again, but gently. "Okay, man. Hang on just one sec.'
p146
aS'I need to see the end of this fucking hallway and then we\'ll get you back upstairs."'
p147
aS"I didn't want him to leave but couldn't think of any sane reason to stop him, so I nodded and let him go. Too many vaguely ill feelings were churning around inside me to sort them out from each other."
p148
aS'"I\'ll wait here," was all I could say, the thought of walking back up twisting stairs feeling for a queasy moment like a bad idea.'
p149
aS"He was already halfway down the hall, but lifted a hand in acknowledgment. Moments later he'd turned the corner and was gone.\n\nIt was suddenly very quiet."
p150
aS'I sunk to a sitting position, knees at my chin, back against the fake wood-paneling. _Why do you always, always drink too much? Idiot._ I tried to focus on the feel of the carpet under my butt, the smoothness of the wall at my back.'
p151
aS'I tried not to think about my stomach.\n\n_Please, please hurry back._'
p152
aS"Something changed around me, subtle but significant. Head swimming, I couldn't lock on to what, at first, was different. I blinked, squinted."
p153
aS'The light. The play of light around me had changed, gone darker, even though none of the wall sconces in my field of vision had gone out or gotten dimmer.'
p154
aS"We were at a T-junction, where the hall we'd come from, back to the big room with the five doorways, had branched in two directions."
p155
aS"I was slumped against the wall facing the way we'd come, head turned towards the right-hand fork, the way Niko had gone."
p156
aS"I decided the dimming must have come from the lights in the hall behind me, the one we hadn't explored yet. They must have gone out.\n\nCareful, still fighting nausea, I turned my head."
p157
aS"I've always had an unhealthy imagination. This has manifested itself in various ways over the course of my life. Staying under the covers reading comics instead of doing homework, or sleeping."
p158
aS'Satisfying myself with vivid fantasies about guys I crushed on rather than risk asking them out in real life. Obsessions, where each new hobby would become all I could think about.'
p159
aS'Things get lodged in my head and they stay there, sometimes for too long.'
p160
aS'The unexplored hall was dark. The wall sconces were unlit, and the dark brown walls sucked up the refracted light from the other two hallways, so that the end of this one, where it turned another corner, was right at the edge of shadow.'
p161
aS'But there was enough light to see that someone was standing there.'
p162
aS"I stared and tried to unsee the human shape, to resolve it into a trick of angles and darkness: turn off my brain's over-eager pattern matchers, finding predators in a coincidence of edges."
p163
aS"It didn't help that the hallway was spinning and I felt closer and closer to throwing up each second.\n\nIt moved."
p164
aS"The shadow took a step forward, slow and deliberate. Like a deer not sure if it's seeing a bobcat or a bush. I couldn't see its eyes or expression but it was facing me, looking at me.\n\nAnd then I realized who it was."
p165
aS'Maybe my eyes had adjusted to the dim light, or maybe my imagination was shifting into a higher gear. But like the solution to a puzzle plunking full-formed into my head I recognized, now, who was standing there at the end of the hall.'
p166
aS'It was Niko. Obviously.'
p167
aS'A wave of relief crashed over me. "Jesus, man, you scared the shit out of me." Or maybe the wave wasn\'t relief. I swallowed hard to keep my stomach from heaving. Something was still wrong but I didn\'t want to think about it. "I, uh.'
p168
aS'Probably need to head back up," I added, keeping my voice cheerful, looking down at the carpet, looking anywhere but him, still standing at the end of the dark hall.'
p169
aS"Everything probably made sense, if I could just see how: why he hadn't said anything, why he was standing there. Did the hallway he'd left down even connect to that one?"
p170
aS'I clutched the carpet under my hand, feeling for the solidness of it, an anchor back to reality.'
p171
aS'Silence. I looked back up, unwillingly, the walls refusing to stay still. The face was still dark but I recognized the way the body held itself, the silhouette it made, the shoes. Unmistakable.'
p172
aS'I knew the shape of his body as well as I knew my own.'
p173
aS'I squinted into the darkness, seeing something else now. Something barely visible, even deeper in the shadows.\n\nThere was more than one of him.'
p174
aS"The second stood just behind the first, so I couldn't see its face either: but it was the same silhouette, the same height, the same shape. It was another one, identical. Another Niko."
p175
aS'It had been there all along, hidden behind the first, and I could only see it now because they were moving again, lifting up the other foot, still slow, still hesitant, following the double in almost perfect synchronicity.'
p176
aS'Like they were glued together.\n\nThey put the feet down, gentle, soundless on the thick carpet.'
p177
aS'Another pace closer.'
p178
aS"_Seeing double. You're drunk._ Except I'd never had it happen in three dimensions before, along the z-plane. And the edges of the hall weren't doubled at all."
p179
aS'I wondered how many more were stacked up behind them.'
p180
aS"How many more I couldn't see, each pressed up against the last, a line vanishing into the darkness, stretching back god knows how far, patient, waiting for something I could never understand.\n\nI wondered what they wanted."
p181
aS'I wondered how fast they could reach me if they started to run.'
p182
aS'"What you looking at?"'
p183
aS'Niko asked from behind me, and I _leapt_, fucking leapt to my feet like the floor was electric, whirling around to face him, body in full panic as all the building adrenalin flooded through me in an instant;'
p184
aS"panting and overwhelmed with terror and nausea and a terrible, stabbing relief at seeing him, seeing a him that was familiar instead of a thing that wasn't."
p185
aS'"The lights back there went out," I said, gasping, not looking behind me. Also, more certain: "I need to throw up."'
p186
aS'He clapped my shoulder, grim. "Let\'s get you back upstairs."'
p187
aS"I let him shepherd me away. I didn't look back down the hall."
p188
aS'But as we left, his arm protective on my shoulders, he frowned. "Pretty sure those lights were out when we first came down here, man."'
p189
aS"Chapter 2\n\nTurned out Niko hadn't found the end of the hallway. It had twisted a couple more times, he said, then split again. But that was all academic while I was puking my guts out over a toilet bowl, and for much of the awful day after."
p190
aS"Still, it might seem odd that we didn't go back down there to map the whole thing out right away. I can't really explain it, unless Niko was already feeling the same irrational foreboding as me."
p191
aS"Anyway. I knew there wasn't really anything down there, Downstairs, and as the hangover faded so did the lingering terror. Replacing it was a giddy sensation like having too much Halloween candy."
p192
aS'There was a whole huge secret basement under our house that only we knew about. It felt good to have another secret. Another code in our personal dictionary, something only for us.'
p193
aS'Niko was terrible at secrets. By next afternoon, all the other housemates had seen Downstairs too, as well as a couple of his basketball buddies and one or two of his closest chess buddies.'
p194
aS"(He'd made a point of changing majors and hobbies once a quarter for the past year, while continuing to swear up and down to his immigrant parents he was still majoring in Economics.)"
p195
aS'I tried not to take the betrayal personally, but kind of failed.'
p196
aS'But the strange thing was that no one seemed much interested.'
p197
aS'Everyone agreed Downstairs was a cool find, and made for a great hangout spot, but no one cared to venture too far outside the big central room, or spend too much time down there.'
p198
aS"Everyone other than Niko and I would get bored, start talking about other things, eventually drift back upstairs to whatever they'd been doing before.\n\nOdd, in hindsight."
p199
aS'We did end up moving a couple couches down (and it was murder getting them around those tight landings, let me tell you) and a half-dozen boxes of my records,'
p200
aS'and made the Big Room available as a kind of secondary hangout space, quieter than the crowded front room with the TV and people always coming and going.'
p201
aS"Some of the empty rooms off the big one turned into overflow storage for everyone's miscellaneous shit, but remained otherwise unoccupied."
p202
aS'"Man, y\'all could live rent-free," one of Niko\'s ex-bandmates said one night while we were down there, poking her head into another lonely room. "Let these out to those poor engineering frosh. They don\'t see no daylight anyway."'
p203
aS'"Yeah," I said, "except everyone would have to come in and out through my bed."'
p204
aS'"I mean they wouldn\'t walk directly over you," she explained, patting a patronizing hand on my shoulder. "Even though I know that kind of sad sack white boy victim scene is right up your alley.'
p205
aS'You ask nice, they\'ll just gently kick you out of the way."'
p206
aS"I liked most of Niko's friends, but I don't think the feeling was mutual. I'm sure they all wondered what he saw in me."
p207
aS'No one did end up moving down there. Zero natural light is kind of a downer, even for well-adjusted people. Niko made some noise about bringing a girl down sometime. ("Dude, it\'s a secret make-out lair.'
p208
aS'You\'re doing college wrong if you don\'t get some action down there.") But we both knew he wouldn\'t actually do it.'
p209
aS'It was too quiet, for one thing.'
p210
aS"It also felt forbidden, somehow, but not in like a sexy rule-breaking kind of way. Being down there had the vague flavor of trespassing, the kind where you're not going to get away with it and it'll go bad for you when you get caught."
p211
aS"Sneaking into a restricted area at the airport; busting into Area 51. I mean it was our house, right? But Downstairs didn't feel like ours."
p212
aS"Enough laughter or booze or noise and the feeling went away, or at least buried itself somewhere deep, where you'd hardly ever notice it."
p213
aS'Maybe because of that, definitely because of day-to-day distractions, maybe also because we enjoyed prolonging the sense of mystery,'
p214
aS'and, okay, because I was sulking, more than a week passed before we got around to scoping out the place in depth.'
p215
aS"Niko spent a day in an extraordinary funk of fierce depression followed by an equally intense reversal, like he'd do from time to time, and I took advantage of his high to prod him into going to explore Downstairs."
p216
aS'He took to this plan eagerly, and seemed pleased when I told him I\'d been waiting so we could do it together. "Ryan," he said fondly, "in an emergency, you know, you can do things without me. I\'ll allow it."'
p217
aS'"Well, I kind of thought this was like, our thing, you know."'
p218
aS'He fell onto one knee. "Oh, my noble Orion," he intoned, "canst thou e\'er forgive such rank betrayal, breaking this our vow of secrecy? Will thy gentle heart recover---"\n\n"Okay, okay," I said, waving my hand. "Get over yourself."'
p219
aS"He leapt up with a wicked grin, made himself a pot of coffee, put on a truly awful and unseasonable Christmas sweater, and headed Downstairs with me to map out what was down there.\n\nExcept we couldn't."
p220
aS"We'd grabbed flashlights in case of dark corners or burnt-out bulbs, but didn't need them. Every hall was lit by those cheerful bright wall sconces, and most of the side rooms had a single bare bulb in the center of the ceiling."
p221
aS"But it was the damnedest thing. We couldn't find an end to the place. We picked one hallway and wandered around for maybe fifteen minutes, through T-junctions and ninety-degree corners, past dozens of doors and empty rooms."
p222
aS'The same wood-paneled walls, seventies carpet, and wall sconces were everywhere. Downstairs was aggressively bland but disturbingly unbounded. It went from weird to surreal to sort of frightening, how much of it there was.'
p223
aS'And this was just one of the five hallways off the central room.'
p224
aS"I'd poked my head into a room with a nook at the far end, a wooden dowel running along the top---like a doorless closet, maybe."
p225
aS'I wandered over to investigate, hoping for a few dusty hangers, the remnants of an old calendar, some comforting sign of former human occupation. No such luck.'
p226
aS'I mean, the place looked like people should have lived there, but there was almost nothing around to prove it.'
p227
aS'Anonymous marks scuffed the walls, the odd piece of lint dotted the floor, but there were no height marks penciled on door frames, no piles of old magazines, no bright squares on dirty walls where pictures once hung.'
p228
aS'Not a single old candy wrapper or forgotten sock. I ran my hand across the wooden dowel and wondered who had put it there, if anyone had ever hung clothes from it.'
p229
aS"I turned around and saw Niko hadn't followed me in. I felt a moment of disorientation. The door seemed a long way away."
p230
aS"No---blinking, I realized it wasn't that. When I'd turned back toward the doorway, it wasn't there."
p231
aS"I frowned. The doorway was on the other side of the room from the one I'd instinctively turned to. I thought I'd walked along the wall to get to the nook, that it and the door had been on the same side."
p232
aS'But the door was on the opposite wall, diagonally across from me.'
p233
aS"I closed my eyes, suddenly dizzy. I remembered keeping the faded white wall to my right as I crossed the carpet to the closet nook. But when I looked again, the door was still where it was, in the opposite corner. Obviously it hadn't moved."
p234
aS"_You're doing it again._"
p235
aS"_Don't see things that aren't there. You fucking idiot._"
p236
aS"Pushing away the uneasiness, I crossed diagonally across the carpet to the door, unable as I did to shake the sensation that I was tracing a different path than the one I'd walked coming in.\n\nThat this door led somewhere else."
p237
aS'I pushed my head out into the hallway. It looked just the same. Of course, they all did.\n\n"Niko?"'
p238
aS'No answer.'
p239
aS"_Okay, that's fine_, I thought, keeping a firm grip on myself. I walked down the hall in the direction we'd been headed, peeked around the corner."
p240
aS'More hall, more carpet, more doors. No Niko.\n\nI shouted his name again, louder.'
p241
aS'Nothing.\n\nIt was so quiet.'
p242
aS"I started down the hall, then halfway down thought maybe I should go back, not forward; then stopped in confusion. If you're lost you're supposed to stay put, not wander around.\n\n_I've never been lost in a basement before._"
p243
aS'The knob on the nearest door started to turn.'
p244
aS"My heart tried to jump out my throat. The door thumped. The knob turned the other way, faster, more violent.\n\nWith a shuddery squeal the door burst open, Niko's shoulder leading the rest of him out."
p245
aS'"Stuck," he said, jiggling the knob. "Oh, goddammit. I spilled my coffee."'
p246
aS'We looked down at the new dark stain on the carpet. He licked droplets from his fingers, inspected a candy-caned sweater cuff. "Thank Christ it didn\'t stain the cashmere."'
p247
aS'"That is _not_ cashmere," I said, rolling my eyes. "Hey. Don\'t wander off on me like that."'
p248
aS"I didn't want to admit how spooked I'd been, and thought I'd done a good job hiding it, but of course he knew me better than that."
p249
aS'He stared into me and seeing those emerald eyes full of concern was enough to melt my fear, transmute it into something infinitely better.'
p250
aS'"Okay," I laughed. "You\'re not in trouble. Just stay close, yeah?"'
p251
aS'"Sure, and sorry, but hey." His eyes had a mischievous glint. "Come check it out. I found\n\nstairs."'
p252
aS'* * *\n\nThe new stairs led down into darkness. From the top we could see about twenty or thirty steps before things got shadowy, and enough of the shadows to tell the stairs kept descending for a while after that.'
p253
aS'Niko had been excited to show me, but now he perched uneasily on the top step. I got out my flashlight and switched it on, pointing down. "Come on. Maybe there\'s some answers down there." He still looked hesitant.'
p254
aS'I put on my straightest face and my best P.I. voice. "Don\'t you want to get... to the bottom of this?"'
p255
aS'"Mmm." He frowned in concern. "I just wouldn\'t want your boyfriend to get jealous, me spending all this time down here with you."'
p256
aS"This was a little joke of his. I didn't have a boyfriend."
p257
aS'But he flicked on his own light, waved me on. "After you, amigo."'
p258
aS'There were maybe ninety steps. Other than that, and the fact that we were lighting our way with flashlights, they seemed like any other stairs in a house built during the Ford administration and sinking into senility. That same damn carpet.'
p259
aS'They must have bought up the whole factory.'
p260
aS'The wall sconces were still there, but no longer lit. Still no light switches anywhere.'
p261
aS'When the stairs finally gave out, it was into another hallway, nearly identical to the ones above.'
p262
aS'This one felt a bit smaller, and the carpet a darker shade, looking more brown now, though maybe both impressions were a trick of the flashlights. Funny how much light influences your perception of spaces, of shapes. Colors.'
p263
aS'Everything, really.'
p264
aS"More rooms opened off this hall, though these had more variety. A few doors were locked, which we hadn't encountered on the upper level. Some of the rooms seemed like bedrooms: a few even had old bed frames and mattresses in them."
p265
aS"I searched the walls in vain for colored tacks with ripped corners of posters still attached, or even a crumpled gas station receipt. It wasn't like the place was sterile."
p266
aS'Another room had a drain in the floor with stains running up to two big utility hookups on the wall, and the faint smells of dust and moths and yellowing wallpaper glue were everywhere. What was missing was anything personal.'
p267
aS'The weirdest room, though, was the kitchen.'
p268
aS'It was too big for a kitchen, for starters, and had too much stuff in it: too many oven hookups, too much haphazard ceiling ventilation,'
p269
aS'red-handled water valves everywhere, and a dozen jumbled stove tops with holes where the burners should be.'
p270
aS'There were parts of appliances but no whole ones: bundles of wiring, even a kitchen sink. Niko tried the faucet and we both were startled when hot water came out.'
p271
aS'It was like a half-assembled restaurant kitchen with all the equipment jumbled together, rather than a row of stoves here, a row of dishwashers there.'
p272
aS'I found what was clearly the plumbing for a toilet hookup in the middle of one wall, and had to put my foot down about this making any sense at all.'
p273
aS'"Maybe a wall was supposed to go up here?" Niko shined his light between the bathroom plumbing and the nearest stovetop, but the kitchen stuff extended to either side.'
p274
aS'"Who puts a toilet in the middle of a kitchen?" I didn\'t get it.\n\nHe shrugged.'
p275
aS'Just the one door, too, and nothing nearby that might have been a dining room or pantry. A few doors down was a long, narrow room paved entirely in yellow bathroom tile and graying grout.'
p276
aS'A rust-pitted shower head, two immobile handles, and dirt-clogged drain clustered at one end, thirty feet away from the opposite wall.'
p277
aS'"You get the feeling whoever built this place didn\'t exactly know a lot about architecture?" Niko\'s voice was hushed in a kind of reverence. "Everything down here\'s off, you know?'
p278
aS'Like, who was that old lady in California who built that house with all the doors that went nowhere and fake hallways and everything?"'
p279
aS"Sarah Winchester. I told him. Except her house is now an internationally famous tourist attraction. And this place was bigger.\n\nWhy didn't anyone _know_ about this?"
p280
aS'Niko was thinking along the same lines. "Seriously, though. Who the fuck built all this? And why? For what?"'
p281
aS'"No clue. But if there\'s any explanation, it\'s probably down here somewhere." I even half-believed that, which felt nice.'
p282
aS'"I feel weird walking around a crazy person\'s house." His eyes darted around the empty room. "Not that I expect, like, pit traps and rotating blades. But it feels sort of... unsafe."'
p283
aS'He had finished his coffee and was fiddling nervously with the mug, twirling it by the handle back and forth in his fingers.'
p284
aS'He kept glancing at me like he wanted me to say something that would make him feel better, to save him, so I tried my best like always. "You ever notice old horror movies have lots of really improbable architecture?" I babbled.'
p285
aS'"I want to meet some of those architects. Probably all dead now but I still want to grab them by their ghostly lapels and ask why the fuck they built all those crawlspaces and secret torture rooms and basements without proper lighting."'
p286
aS'"You\'re freaking me out, man," Niko said. He held the light under his face, washing it out to a ghostly tan as his eyes rolled up into his head. "Vreeaking meee owwwwt."\n\n"Attractive."'
p287
aS'"You would totally date undead me. Rotting flesh and all. Don\'t pretend you wouldn\'t."'
p288
aS'"You\'re half-skeleton already. There\'s barely any flesh to rot off you."'
p289
aS'"Come on." He grabbed my shoulder and propelled me down the hall. "Let\'s keep going." The rough of his hand shocked some courage back into me. My shoulder felt cool when he took the hand away.'
p290
aS"A few more paces down the hallway, it opened into an octagonal room, a closed door in each wall other than the one we'd entered through. We tried a few. Each door opened onto another staircase leading down."
p291
aS'"But _seriously_," Niko said, alarmed. "This cannot possibly be here. It doesn\'t make sense." He looked towards me, desperate. "Ryan, help."'
p292
aS'"Okay," I said, grasping at straws. "Maybe it\'s like a whole underground network. All the houses in the neighborhood connected together. People used to smuggle drugs or something. Underground railroad."'
p293
aS'"Decor\'s too new," he countered. "And we haven\'t found any other stairs back up."'
p294
aS'"Secret government lab, then. Long-term research on the effects of interior decorating on lonely housewives. Program got relocated to Washington along with all the lonely housewives when Clinton was elected."'
p295
aS'He shook his head. "Let\'s go back, man. I don\'t like this. Something\'s not right."'
p296
aS'I peered down one of the dark stairwells, frustrated. It bothered me that we might be so close to figuring this out. The next door might open onto something that explained it all.'
p297
aS"And an undercurrent of excitement cut through the tinge of fear. This was fun. We were exploring. On a quest together.\n\nI didn't want it to end."
p298
aS'"It can\'t go on forever," I said. "And whatever\'s deepest down will be most interesting, right?"'
p299
aS"I talked him into it. After all there was nothing dangerous down here: it wasn't like exploring an abandoned mine shaft. Everything was in perfect repair even if no one seemed to have been here for years."
p300
aS'"Solid enough," Niko said, poking at the wall. "Just not a lot of, you know. Ambiance."'
p301
aS"The staircase we picked dropped down for a few dozen steps, then turned at a weird angle and dropped some more. It wasn't necessarily smaller but felt more claustrophobic."
p302
aS'Maybe that was my brain reminding me how deep underground we must be getting. At most of the landings a new hall branched off, each at a different angle. We kept going down.'
p303
aS'After four or five weird angled twists the stairs ended, opening up into another corridor. Everything felt exactly the same, despite being stories deeper underground. It was as bland and anonymous as office space in a skyscraper.'
p304
aS'There were more doors.'
p305
aS"We shuffled past them, flashlights glinting off doorknobs and---_there_ was a difference---instead of the wall sconces, fake candelabra now. You know the ones, with those awful faux-candles that flicker orange and don't fool anyone?"
p306
aS"They weren't lit now, anyway."
p307
aS"It's hard to explain the quiet. It felt complete in a deeper way than absence of sound. Like we were far away from anything that made noise, other than us. I guess we were."
p308
aS'We stopped less to try side doors now, eager to get to the end of the hall, or the end of something, at least. Find some answers.'
p309
aS"For a long stretch there were no doors at all, just wood paneling, so that when we did come to another door it was a relief, like exhaling held breath. Niko tried it, and it swung open onto a room unlike anything we'd seen so far."
p310
aS'It was concrete and tall, with rounded corners at the bottom. The ceiling was higher than the walls, like we were in a pit dug into a bigger room. In the center of the concrete floor was a drain.'
p311
aS'Niko, intrigued, grabbed the bottom of a short ladder that ended around shoulder-height and pulled himself up to the top of the pit, flashlight swinging wildly. I clung to mine, keeping it steady like a candle I was afraid would blow out.'
p312
aS'I felt afraid, without knowing why.'
p313
aS'He shined his light back down at me. "Yep," he said, "it\'s a swimming pool."'
p314
aS'That made sense, by some incredibly loose definition. "What\'s up there?"'
p315
aS'He turned away from the lip, moved out of sight. Patterns of light swam across the ceiling as he swung the flashlight around. Something rattled. "Another kitchen." His voice bounced oddly off the rounded concrete.'
p316
aS'"This one\'s all furnished, though."'
p317
aS'I was getting more and more unsettled, unaccountably so. "Any more doors?"'
p318
aS'The reflections of light moved to and fro, like something alive. "Nope. No way in or out except through the pool. And there\'s no place to sit and eat, either." He paused. More scuffling. "Funny. The fridge is locked.'
p319
aS'Like, there\'s a keyhole on the fridge and you can\'t open it. Who does that?"'
p320
aS"The door we'd come through, I noticed, was the same as all the others: cheap particle board, regular brass-plated knob. Not especially waterproof. I bent down, pushed it shut."
p321
aS"Sure enough, there was a gap between it and the top of the carpet. Like you'd expect for any regular door not, you know, at the bottom of a swimming pool."
p322
aS'"Hey, Niko?" I straightened up, keeping my voice steady. "Let\'s go back."'
p323
aS"I wanted to add _I don't like this_ or maybe _I want to get the hell out of here right now_, but some irrational fear gripped me that if I showed any weakness, he'd be the one who wanted to keep going down.\n\nGoing deeper."
p324
aS'Something rattled up there, wood scraping wood. "There\'s silverware in these drawers," he called, as if he hadn\'t heard me. "Cups in the cabinets too. Super seventies. Like the cups your grandma probably has, you know?'
p325
aS'I think Barbarella had these cups."'
p326
aS'His voice was starting to seem unreal. I felt how tenuous a connection I had to him: a voice, the glints of his flashlight on the ceiling above the empty pool. Echoes and shadows.'
p327
aS'The distance between us seemed vast and growing vaster, maybe already unbridgeable. A strange nausea was creeping up on me, an unsettling dizziness, a turning, a skew.'
p328
aS"And then. Maybe I imagined this, between the weird echoes of that concrete pool bottom and the nerves I'd worked up. But I thought I heard muffled voices. Faint. Coming through the wall."
p329
aS'Coming from the other side of the closed door back.'
p330
aS'Chapter 3\n\nI stumbled back from the door, heart pounding. "Niko," I hissed, trying to inject all the urgency I felt into the shape of his name, "get back down here, right now!"'
p331
aS'He must have heard something in my voice, because seconds later his head poked over the edge, and he slid down the ladder and dropped the last few feet onto concrete.'
p332
aS'I could see him, I could suddenly even smell him, and that tangible reality felt overwhelmingly reassuring. I grabbed his arm and even his awful not-cashmere sweater was comforting.\n\n"What\'s up?"'
p333
aS'"I thought..." The noise had gone; I felt foolish. "I thought I heard someone out there."'
p334
aS'He walked to the door, pulling away from me. "No don\'t!" I hissed, but his hand was already on the knob, he was already turning it, pushing the door open, stepping out into the hallway. Shining his light left, back the way we\'d come.'
p335
aS'He turned, to shine it to the right.'
p336
aS'And for an instant I was sure\n\n something\n\naround the corner was going to grab him and in the same instant with nightmarelogic certainty I knew it was my fault for imagining it\n\n for making it real\n\nbut nothing happened. He shrugged.'
p337
aS'"I don\'t hear anything, man."\n\nNeither did I.'
p338
aS'"Let\'s get back anyway," he said. "We\'ve been down here too long. Your boyfriend\'s going to kill me."'
p339
aS"As we walked back up the hall through the zone with no doors, I glanced back. I noticed with a frown we'd left the door to the pool room open."
p340
aS'It felt wrong, somehow. A bad omen.'
p341
aS'But no way in hell was I walking back to shut it.'
p342
aS"* * *\n\nWe lay on my closed-again bed and stared up at the ceiling, giggling. We couldn't help ourselves. It felt good to be out of there, to have the whole ridiculous mystery literally at our backs."
p343
aS'Even an old mattress felt like shield enough.'
p344
aS"I'd felt better with each upward step."
p345
aS'The earlier rooms were familiar as we hit them in reverse: the octagon with its stairs down, the bright yellow light of the upper halls, Niko\'s coffee stain ("so typical,'
p346
aS'" I told him, "you\'ve marked this place with your distinctive musk") and the big empty room with its couches and piles of everyone\'s junk.'
p347
aS"By the time we'd climbed the final stairs to my room and swung the bed shut, we were giddy, flushed with excitement, brimming with explanations and theories."
p348
aS'"It must run under the whole neighborhood," Niko was saying. "Connect to other houses, or maybe it only used to. Maybe no one knows about it any more." He grinned. "Except us."'
p349
aS'"It doesn\'t make sense," I was still protesting, but it felt more silly than sinister. I shook my head, embarrassed by my freak-out earlier. I was spooking myself for no reason.'
p350
aS"If someone else was down there, wouldn't they have come to say hi?\n\n_Maybe they did._"
p351
aS'I shook my head again. It was cool, and nothing was going to get in the way of that.'
p352
aS"I did some legit research in the next few days. Our landlord stopped by to see how we were settling in and reassure us he'd fix the things he said he'd fix before we moved in, which he clearly wasn't going to fix."
p353
aS'He was a younger guy with kind of a stoner vibe, on the whole not very plausible as a landlord.'
p354
aS"When I casually asked how he'd come to acquire a hundred-year-old house in a rather nice college town, he said he was trying to make a living off rental properties and we were the first students to move into this one."
p355
aS'He mentioned he\'d gotten a good deal on the house because of the maintenance it needed (embarrassed cough) and because the city sold it at auction and they "weren\'t allowed to play bidding games and shit" with it.'
p356
aS'"So the city repossessed it or something? Do you know who owned it before?" I asked, practically exuding casual nonchalance.'
p357
aS'"Rich guy from out of town," he said. "Hadn\'t ever lived here, I don\'t think. Probably hoping this neighborhood was on its way up." He glanced around the tree-line street skeptically. "Guess he got sick of waiting."'
p358
aS'"Do you know who owned it before that?" I asked, but he only shrugged.\n\nI didn\'t ask if he knew anything about a secret basement the size of a city block, because I was afraid our rent would go up.'
p359
aS"Down at city hall I looked up the property history, which I'd hoped would be more interesting than the chemistry I should have been studying. The house had indeed been built about a hundred years earlier."
p360
aS'The records were aggressively boring. Certainly nothing about enormous sub-basements or a fleet of mining vehicles. I even hunted through microfilm of the local paper for anything unusual the week of construction. No dice.'
p361
aS'After that, the trail went a bit cold because I had another acne flare-up, a bad one, dropped out of a class instead of showing up to take the midterm and felt generally miserable about myself for a couple of days.'
p362
aS"I finally pulled myself together enough to get some groceries and refill the expired prescription on my acne cream. I was in the bathroom, rubbing it on my pockmarked face and thinking about how much I'd been lied to as a kid."
p363
aS"_Oh, that'll clear up when you get older._ Also _You'll figure girls out eventually_ and _There's someone out there for everyone_. Classics, all."
p364
aS'Niko popped his head around the corner. "Dude. Phone\'s for you." He blinked at me. "You realize when you do that, it looks like you\'re rubbing jizz all over your face."'
p365
aS"I didn't really see it. The last thing I thought about when looking in the mirror was anything sexy."
p366
aS'He must have guessed what I\'d been thinking, because he punched my shoulder. "Dude, get over yourself. You\'re not Quasimodo." He sighed. "We need to get you a boyfriend."'
p367
aS'"Store was fresh out," I said, but grimly resolved to start wearing my pride bracelet out in public again. "Who\'s on the phone?"'
p368
aS'"Some lady from the local history society? I thought she had the wrong number, but she asked for you by name."'
p369
aS"I had in fact called the history society a few days earlier, and the voice on the phone belonged to an elderly woman who breathlessly said she'd love to chat about the old houses in our neighborhood,"
p370
aS'and invited us over to the society office for a cup of tea.'
p371
aS'The office turned out to be her living room. We sat on a sun-faded couch sipping something tasteless while she fawned over us ("so _wonderful_ to see young people take an interest in local history"). It was awkward.'
p372
aS'I asked if she knew anything interesting about our address or any people who used to live there.'
p373
aS"She wasn't familiar with the house, although the mayor had once lived on our street, she told us, and she thought most of the houses near there had been built around the same time."
p374
aS'Flailing, I asked if she knew anything about tunnels or underground rooms around town.'
p375
aS"She spun a not-very-interesting story about how during Prohibition a local bootlegger had dug a tunnel that led from his basement all the way to a poplar in the neighbor's backyard---nearly fifty feet long."
p376
aS'I smiled and nodded until I found a way to excuse us.'
p377
aS'Meanwhile Niko had been making excursions on his own.'
p378
aS"I got kind of upset when he told me---I'd wanted it to be our thing, something we did together---but he said he'd come get me the instant he found anything interesting, and didn't make too big deal out of it. It really bothered me, though."
p379
aS'I thought about going on my own too but it felt wrong without him there. I itched with overwhelming curiosity but also a certain dread that kicked my heartbeat up a notch when I thought about walking too far down those halls, those stairs.'
p380
aS"I told myself I was being stupid but my pulse didn't listen."
p381
aS'Niko spitballed the idea of making a map, but figured it would be tricky. "A lot of those angles are non-standard," he said. "Those funny twists on the stairs down from the octagon, right?'
p382
aS'They\'re more than ninety degrees but less than the next sensible unit---one thirty-five or whatever. I have a feeling if you measured them they\'d be fractional. Like one twenty nine point two three eight three eight." He laughed.'
p383
aS'"Three eight three eight three eight three eight three---"\n\n"Quit it."'
p384
aS'He smirked. "Irrational."'
p385
aS'Some of the halls sloped up or down, too, enough that you could feel it when you walked them. Keeping track of what level everything was on would add to the confusion. I dragged discussion back up to the bigger picture.'
p386
aS'"It has to be mostly running east, doesn\'t it? Because of the hill. That big stairway doesn\'t go down far enough to get under 12th Street."'
p387
aS'"I don\'t know." He visualized with closed eyes for a moment, then shrugged and opened them, shaking his head. "Hard to keep a sense of direction down there. We\'ll bring a compass next trip.'
p388
aS'You think those new GPS things for hiking would work?"'
p389
aS'"No, they need line of sight to the sky. We could leave breadcrumbs, like Hansel and Gretel."'
p390
aS'"We might have to, if it\'s much bigger." His eyes widened. "Can you imagine getting lost? Like some estate agent\'s nightmare. \'My god, I\'ll never be able to replace all this carpet!\'"\n\nWe had a party down there.'
p391
aS"By unspoken agreement, the housemates didn't advertise the extent of the place: I put police caution tape from the dollar store across all the doorways out of the big room, as a joke, though I suspected I wasn't really joking."
p392
aS'It was fine if everyone just saw a chill basement hangout spot. Much levity was made from the fact that you had to climb in and out of my bed to get there, or to go back up and take a piss.'
p393
aS'We brought down a foosball table, some Christmas lights, lots of booze, and the stereo. I protested that my record collection was for archival purposes, not playing at parties, but I was overruled.'
p394
aS'It was an okay turnout and everyone, for all the usual reasons, focused on getting good and drunk. My usual social ineptness kept me from truly enjoying myself.'
p395
aS'Some girl tried to hit on me;'
p396
aS'I was so startled by this I blurted "Actually, I\'m gay," which was even more awkward out loud than it sounds written down,'
p397
aS'and she laughed noisily and commiserated about the tragic ironies of dating for a few embarrassing seconds before vanishing,'
p398
aS'and only too late did I think to ask what the hell had compelled her to talk to me in the first place, because certainly whatever it was had never worked on any guys.'
p399
aS"Not that I'd figured out how to go to parties where guys who'd be interested would hang out, anyway."
p400
aS"I hated dance clubs and the couple gay bars I'd stepped into had given me massive anxiety attacks;"
p401
aS'I still felt a rush of panic when I thought about walking through the door of the tiny LGBT center on campus, even after years of passing it on the way to classes.'
p402
aS"I'd always thought things would get easier in college. At my enormous high school there hadn't been a single out queer person my freshman year, and I'd had no intention of being the first."
p403
aS'Not only because of crippling shyness, self-image issues, and fear for my actual life, but because I literally did not know how to come out.'
p404
aS"Ellen hadn't done it on national TV yet when I was in high school; Kevin Kline hadn't done it at the movies, let alone sultry-eyed Jake Gyllenhaal;"
p405
aS'not enough gay teens had been famously killed or killed themselves to inspire anyone to tell us It Gets Better.'
p406
aS'Gay people basically did not exist in my universe, and yet there was I, somehow, gay regardless. College was supposed to have been an improvement. But once I got there, I failed to blossom into a beautiful flower.'
p407
aS"Maybe I should have moved farther away, to an actual big city, rather than somewhere close by and familiar and still red-state as fuck: but the problem wasn't my environment, I came to realize, it was me."
p408
aS"It wasn't that I had issues with being gay: the internet had given me plenty of opportunities to come to terms and feel okay about it."
p409
aS"I just didn't know how to be it in public, with other people, on any level but especially a romantic one, especially after what had happened in high school."
p410
aS'Meanwhile the straight people were having a nice party.'
p411
aS'Niko, wearing a blue bowling shirt with "My Name is BONG" stitched into the lapel and a pair of tight-fitting lime-green jeans, whose only virtue was the tight-fitting part, was shadowing some girl he\'d been trying to hit it off with.'
p412
aS'It wasn\'t going well. They got into an argument early in the evening (Dear LiveJournal: I tune out when I hear the phrase "That\'s _not_ what Marx said") and she stormed off up the stairs.'
p413
aS'Niko fumed, then stormed off himself, reappearing minutes later in a Linkin Park t-shirt and torn jeans and carrying a bottle of tequila, which he used like a police baton to corral me into a corner to do shots with him.'
p414
aS'"Said I dress too fucking weird for her," he said with a hollow Ashes to Ashes sort of intonation. "Is _this_ fucking normal enough? Whatever. The hell with everyone." I could drink to that.'
p415
aS'We threw back a shot, sitting on the carpet with our backs to the paneled wall. Niko was always swinging between extremes: at high ebbs he wanted to be friends with everyone, at low ebbs I was the only person in the universe.'
p416
aS"He was busy furiously ignoring the rest of the party, which I wasn't feeling much connection to either."
p417
aS'He sniffed. "You know when we first moved over here I didn\'t speak any English?" I nodded; I\'d heard this story before. "My parents thought it\'d be cute to dump me into third grade like that. You know, _full immersion_." His face twisted.'
p418
aS"I poured him another shot, thinking I probably shouldn't, but by then I already had."
p419
aS'He leaned back against the wall, looking worn down. "I tried so fucking hard to fit in. To get to where just opening my mouth didn\'t mark me out as a freak. By the time junior high started none of the new kids even knew.'
p420
aS'Master fucking performance." He tugged at the t-shirt, a corner of his mouth twitching. "Meanwhile the fam all expects things to be exactly like we\'d never left.'
p421
aS"Like America's just a little rest stop, like of course I'll want to go back to Greece and have a million kids as soon as I graduate. My aunt asked me at Thanksgiving why I wasn't married yet."
p422
aS'I reminded her I am twenty-two years old and still in the middle of fucking college. She said neither of those things stopped my uncle."'
p423
aS'I was staring idly at a dark-haired girl and a bearded jock flirting on the couch across the room, words swallowed up by the thumping of the stereo. Thinking about the music echoing down all those empty halls.'
p424
aS'"I can\'t even imagine getting married."\n\n"Yeah, neither can the government."'
p425
aS'"Not just that, asshole." I side-kicked him, then frowned, trying to figure out what I wanted to say. "I don\'t know. I can\'t imagine anyone wanting to spend the rest of their life with me.'
p426
aS'Or that I could believe someone would say yes, if I wanted to with them."'
p427
aS'I closed my mouth, feeling stupid, but he was nodding. "Yeah, I dig you. Thinking you could be that for someone. Believing in yourself that much." He was frowning. "I can\'t believe in anything they fucking want me to be."'
p428
aS'He tilted his head back, eyes closed. "Well, you ever make it there, you got a best man lined up at least." He opened one skeptical eye. "Or are there two best men? How would all that even work?"'
p429
aS'"I don\'t know." I closed my eyes, too. _Dear LiveJournal. Figure out how all that even works._'
p430
aS'We listened to the music for a minute, surrounded by people who naturally knew how to Saturday night, without training. It was kind of nice being near them, at least.'
p431
aS'Niko said, very quiet: "Can\'t get married till you go on at least one date."'
p432
aS'"Thanks," I said. "Good tip."'
p433
aS'"For reals, though. You need to put yourself out there, man. Get over whatever hang-ups you got going on."'
p434
aS'"New topic." I moved to pour myself another shot. He grabbed the bottle, held it out of reach.'
p435
aS'"Nuh uh. Confession time. I went, now it\'s your turn."\n\n"Fuck you."'
p436
aS'"Seriously, man." He sat up straighter, fixed me with that look that told me I wasn\'t getting it. "I know you\'ve dated before. In high school, right? Wasn\'t his name Brandon or something?"'
p437
aS'"Bradley," I said against my will, something inside me deflating. I still didn\'t want to tell him, but realized I was going to.'
p438
aS'"So what happened? Bad breakup?"'
p439
aS"I closed my eyes, not wanting to rip open these scabs. Not on a Saturday night I'd almost been enjoying."
p440
aS'"I broke up with him," I said quietly, but it was enough for it all to start coming out. "Yeah, okay. The story. So I knew him from band, and he cornered me after practice one day. Someone told him I was into weird old music too.'
p441
aS'He\'s got all these bizarro cross-genre mix tapes in his backpack, pulls some out to play for me. Adorable. We hung out in the band room listening to them for hours after everyone else had gone home."'
p442
aS'I sighed. "It took me a while to figure out the signals he was sending because I had no idea how to, like, receive them. But we figured it out in the end. It was, you know. All that first love stuff. Sneaking out at midnight.'
p443
aS'Lots of giggling. It was amazing. At first."'
p444
aS'"Uh oh." Niko slouched back down, settling in for the long haul.'
p445
aS'I tried to keep talking even though I could feel myself clenching up, chest muscles trembling. "It just became apparent pretty quick that he was way, way more into me than I was into him.'
p446
aS'He _loved_ me with every part of himself"---I could feel Niko\'s eyebrows waggling but I pressed on, knew I couldn\'t stop the story now---"and it was so fierce it was... like being burned. It _hurt_, that I couldn\'t love him back like that.'
p447
aS'I didn\'t know how to take it. And then one day at lunch in the cafeteria I was going to break up with him and I think he sensed it coming, wanted to stop it. So he---oh god."'
p448
aS'I closed my eyes and, yup, there they were: moisture squeezed out between them. "We weren\'t out, you know. In our town. At our school especially. Nobody was.'
p449
aS"He stands up on the table, little Bradley Thompson, shouts for attention, shouts in a louder voice than I'd ever heard him use that we're in love,"
p450
aS'that we didn\'t care who knew it, that our love would last forever and nobody in the universe could stop it."'
p451
aS'"Shit," Niko breathed.'
p452
aS'I took a quick breath. "I don\'t really remember the rest of that day. I know we got sent to the principal\'s office because that\'s where my mom picked me up from.'
p453
aS"There were adults in the cafeteria so I don't think anyone tried anything, but I'm sure the reaction would have been... laughter. Disgust. Thrown banana peels."
p454
aS'Maybe some kids would have thought about stopping it, standing up, supporting us, but I doubt anyone actually did, would have dared. But I don\'t remember. It\'s all blank. Just... the aftermath."\n\n"Yeah?"'
p455
aS'"We broke up," I said, "and I want to talk about that part even less." I pulled the bottle out of his loose fingers and finally poured the shot, downed it.\n\n"That is the worst coming out story I\'ve ever heard."'
p456
aS'"Not really." I shrugged. "I didn\'t get kicked out of my house. Didn\'t get sent to the emergency room. Guess that was probably when I started drinking, though. I was a good kid before that."'
p457
aS'"You\'ve always been a good kid," he said, managing not to make it sound like an insult. "So look, just so you know. Dating is generally speaking a lot better than that."'
p458
aS'"So I hear." My mood was bottoming out into pitch-black despondency. "Haven\'t really worked up the enthusiasm to find out, though."'
p459
aS'From the corner of my eye I could see him looking at me, the flashing Christmas lights lost in his black curls, more swallowed up than reflected by them. He seemed fragile in the shifting light. Sharp, but delicate. Able to be shattered.'
p460
aS"I knew he was trying to think of something encouraging to say and all at once I couldn't stand the thought."
p461
aS'I pushed out words. "Can we just, like. Not talk any more."'
p462
aS'"No problemo." He slumped back against the wall. But he leaned into me, just a little. I leaned into him, too.\n\nWe stayed like that for a few minutes.'
p463
aS'Then some friends of his tromped down the stairs and he leapt up, pulling a sparkling smile and manic laugh out from somewhere, pouring drinks and giving high fives,'
p464
aS'and dragged me with him into the noise, and one of his friends talked me into getting trounced at foosball, and everyone kept drinking.'
p465
aS'And the moment between us faded into ephemera and lost any possible significance, even to me.'
p466
aS"Not long after, Niko disappeared. I figured maybe he'd gone back to his room to be alone: despite appearances, his social energy was limited, had to be rationed."
p467
aS"I didn't think anything of it, focused on getting drunk with everyone else because it seemed like the thing to do.\n\nMidnight passed, unnoticed."
p468
aS'Some time later the party started winding down. Soon it had winnowed to a couple hardcore foosballers, the girl and the beardy dude making out on the couch, and a few sozzled, earnest conversations in corners.'
p469
aS"I extracted myself from one of these, but on my way upstairs to take a leak I noticed that the flashlight we'd left by the hall---the one that led to the octagon room, the long stairs, and the pool---was gone."
p470
aS"Had he gone exploring? Tonight?\n\nIf he had, he'd been gone a long time."
p471
aS"An hour later the party had just about wrapped. Still no sign of Niko. I'd checked his bedroom---empty---and polled a few housemates. No one had seen him since the start of the night."
p472
aS'I felt a stab of guilt for getting so wasted, for not looking out for him; pushed down vague resentments at feeling like I had to.'
p473
aS'I was standing at the hallway wondering if I should go look for him, when a shadow appeared at its end and my body tried to jump out of my skin.'
p474
aS'It was him, of course. But my relief only lasted for a second. As he got closer, a prickling sense crept into my bones that something was wrong.'
p475
aS"He grinned when he saw me, but it was forced, and he was walking too fast. His face was beaded with cold sweat, and he was ashen, like he'd been throwing up.\n\nHe gave me a jaunty wave as he got close, but didn't slow down."
p476
aS'"You okay?" I asked.'
p477
aS'"Peachy," he said. "Going to bed though."'
p478
aS'"Did you---" I wanted to say _see something down there_, but couldn\'t quite work up the nerve. "---have too much to drink or something?"'
p479
aS"He clapped my shoulder as he passed, but didn't look at me, and didn't respond: just kept moving, as fast as possible while still making it look like a casual stroll, toward the stairs. The way back up."
p480
aS"Chapter 4\n\nAfter that everything changed. He'd lost all interest in Downstairs. If I brought it up he'd change the subject; if folks were hanging out down there he wouldn't come."
p481
aS'When I finally asked him directly about this, he shook his head.'
p482
aS'"I don\'t think it\'s a good idea to be down there, that\'s all." He tried to play it off casual, but his jaw was set.'
p483
aS'Something about him had changed. His wardrobe turned straight-laced. He went back to calling himself Nick. He watched a lot of sports on TV.'
p484
aS"And things were strange between us. Our conversations didn't go quite right, didn't fit in their familiar grooves. We'd get derailed, trail off. We started talking less."
p485
aS"I couldn't point to something specific that had changed, but the usual pleasurable tension between us, the taut bond of connection we'd had since the accident, was gone. He didn't seem to need me any more. He seemed like just a dude."
p486
aS'Just a Nick. Not mine.'
p487
aS"I worked up my courage and did a few of my own solo expeditions Downstairs, without telling him, but I couldn't convince myself to go very far. I hallucinated strange noises around corners: floorboards creaking, whispered sighs."
p488
aS"I knew I was only scaring myself, but didn't have it in me to stay down there for long."
p489
aS"I lay on my bed a lot and listened to records through my headphones. My dad's old headphones: huge bulky black things with a coiled cord like old telephones. Sometimes I held my breath while I did it."
p490
aS'This was an old technique of mine to shut the world out. After a while outside sounds would slip away, and the thrum of blood and music would fill my ears, become my entire universe. As a kid I could hold my breath for three minutes.'
p491
aS'Enough sometimes to make it through a whole song without breathing.'
p492
aS'I fell asleep one night doing this, headphones on, and dreamed about Niko, which happened now and then whether I wanted it to or not. In the dream I was at the hallway junction again, looking down into the shadows at the figure at its end.'
p493
aS'It was him again, walking toward me. Not hesitant but confident, smiling, happy to see me. I grinned back, thrilling at the reciprocity between us, a bond that felt in that moment tinged with something else, something more primal.'
p494
aS"But then I faltered, because I realized I wasn't sure quite what that meant. There are a lot of primal emotions.\n\nThere were so many things that smile could mean."
p495
aS'I took a step back, afraid, but there was nothing but empty space behind me. I was standing at the lip of a drop-off.'
p496
aS'He came right up to me, Niko, my Niko, looking into my eyes with something I was certain now was love, and the fear faded as he reached up to touch my cheek,'
p497
aS'and the warmth of it and the smell of him and the look on his face fused inside me into need so intense it parted my lips, as if for oxygen, just as he bent down with hunger to kiss them.'
p498
aS"It was a beatific kiss, velvet, brain-melting, the kind you sometimes get in real life if you're lucky but I'd only ever had in dreams, sweet and lingering and seraphic."
p499
aS"Everything I'd ever wanted flowed through me into him and I imagined I could feel the same from him to me, echoed and amplified, conjoined. It went on and on and on."
p500
aS'He pressed against me, arms wrapped around my back, holding me, and mine were maybe around him too but only limply, subconscious, the kiss and its indescribable tangibility, its dream-forgotten trueness the only thing, the only thing.'
p501
aS"The only thing.\n\nIt wasn't until I'd broken it, pulled back to look up at him, that I realized I was leaning back over the edge behind me, his arms holding me there, my toes the only thing still touching the lip of the drop-off."
p502
aS"I couldn't read his expression. Had no idea what it meant at all.\n\nI didn't even know who he was."
p503
aS'He let me fall.'
p504
aS"I plummeted down into darkness, gathering speed, faster and faster. I'd had dreams before that ended like this, a sickening fall and then an ejection back to wakefulness right as I hit ground, covered in cold sweat and shuddering."
p505
aS"But this time when I woke, it was more like I'd chosen to do it, pulled away from the dream against its will. Like part of me knew if I'd stayed I'd have kept falling forever, because there was no ground down there to stop me."
p506
aS"The record was turning in its final groove. I stared at it dumbly, dad's big headphones still muffling the outside world, transmitting only hissing, clicks and pops."
p507
aS"_This has got to stop_, I told myself, _you're over him. You got over him a long time ago._ The accident had confused everything but in the months after it I'd sorted myself out, realized it was never going to happen."
p508
aS"Put it away and moved on. I had. It was just my fucking dreams didn't seem to have gotten the memo."
p509
aS'I felt Downstairs tingling at my back, beneath me. I switched the player off and took my blanket to sleep on the couch in the living room.'
p510
aS'* * *\n\nOne night not long after that, everyone but Niko and I had left for an overnight road trip. We started drinking, and it seemed to ease the friction between us, which made us both want to keep drinking.'
p511
aS'I took comfort in this, maybe the first acknowledgment that he felt the gap between us too, wanted as much as me to find a way to close it.'
p512
aS'Deep into a bottle of vodka, we got into one of those hilarious drunken arguments about nothing: a line from one of our favorite songs. I was sure it was one thing, he was sure it was something a few words off.'
p513
aS'I knew I was right, and also could see why he might remember it wrong, but he refused to believe me.'
p514
aS'He tried to pull out his cell phone to call a friend for a second opinion and got it stuck on something in his pocket: laughing,'
p515
aS"he ended up dumping everything out on the table, but then we got distracted by a text he'd gotten from an ex-girlfriend,"
p516
aS'which led to more drinking and another argument where I dutifully tried to keep him from responding,'
p517
aS'not just because he was drunk and she was terrible for him but because back then with those flip phones it would have taken him a fucking hour to peck out a reply.'
p518
aS'We ended up slumped in our chairs, the vodka bottle empty, listening to some spacey ambient music on the stereo.'
p519
aS'I had about drifted off when I\nshook myself awake. Niko was out cold. Before I could wake him and convince him to drag himself to bed I noticed something out of the corner of my eye.'
p520
aS"In the pile of stuff he'd pulled from his pocket (phone, wallet, keys, crumpled receipts) were two small brass keys.\n\nThey weren't on his keyring, just loose in his pocket, and faintly corroded with age."
p521
aS'It was hard to tell for sure, but they looked identical.'
p522
aS"Nothing about this was all that unusual but somehow I knew one of those keys would fit the fridge Downstairs. Don't ask how I knew this, because I couldn't tell you, but I did. Irrational."
p523
aS"That ridiculous locked fridge in that ridiculous kitchen atop a ridiculous empty pool.\n\nHe'd been keeping something from me too."
p524
aS'Had he found something in there? Something that scared him off going back?'
p525
aS'What inside a fridge could be that scary? Could make him lie to his best friend?'
p526
aS"I'm not sure why I did it. The vodka, maybe. Repressed curiosity. Or maybe the growing frustration that something had happened to Niko, something had changed; but I wasn't allowed to know what it was, or ever put it right."
p527
aS"Quietly, I took the keys. I shouldn't have, but by then I already had."
p528
aS"* * *\n\nThe house was dead quiet, which made the transition to Downstairs feel even more natural. Despite my earlier trepidations, I wasn't afraid as I grabbed the flashlight by the hallway. Vodka is magic."
p529
aS"I passed through the first few hallways, the stairs where the lights went out, the dark lower corridors. It wasn't until I hit the octagon that I got scared again."
p530
aS"I'd been walking on autopilot, lost in musing, but as I stepped into that room with its stairs leading down, I pulled up short. The flashlight was dimmer."
p531
aS"My eyes had adjusted, but through my liquor-addled head I noticed the room was still less bright than the last time I'd been down here.\n\nNiko must have run down the batteries with all his exploring."
p532
aS'This didn\'t especially worry me: after our first trip I\'d brought up this possibility. "Yeah, fuck that," he\'d said, and duct-taped four fresh batteries to the long body of the flashlight.'
p533
aS"But it did occur to me---now---that to change them down here I'd have to do it in total darkness. Fiddling with sticky tape, fumbling to unscrew the light, pouring out the old batteries and not mixing them up with the new ones, by feel..."
p534
aS'So there was that.'
p535
aS'I thought for a minute about going back. But I was close to the pool room now. I wanted to find out what was inside that fridge. What Niko had been keeping from me.'
p536
aS'And I did have the batteries, after all. If I needed to change them, it would just take a second.\n\nI kept going.'
p537
aS'The last set of stairs down, with their weird irrational angles, passed quickly. The hall at the bottom stretched into the gloom, and I sped past the long stretch with no doors till I reached the pool room.'
p538
aS'The door was closed. So Niko _had_ been back here.'
p539
aS'Inside was the smooth, curved concrete of the pool bottom. I grabbed for the lowest rung of the ladder and pulled myself up, a familiar motion from my swimming days made unfamiliar through lack of buoyancy, being clothed and bone-dry.'
p540
aS'The upper level had a lip about three feet wide extending around the edge of the empty pool, and on the ladder side the space opened up, concrete giving way to linoleum.'
p541
aS'Sure enough, there was a full kitchen up there, just like Niko had described. With all the appliances, it was fairly cozy. I stared bemused at the chrome dials on the oven, the row of pale-green cabinets with round white handles.'
p542
aS'I turned to the fridge. It looked dated, a fading yellow with tacky chrome highlights. It only had one big door; no freezer. No magnets or family photos, either. Generically anonymous.'
p543
aS"I tugged at the handle, but it didn't budge. Studying it, I saw what Niko had been talking about: there was a small keyhole under the handle. Smaller than a house key: more like one for a padlock, something you'd put on a shed."
p544
aS"The keys I'd lifted from Niko looked about right."
p545
aS"I picked one and slid it into the lock. It went in smooth, with a satisfying click as it bottomed out. But when I turned it, it wouldn't rotate."
p546
aS'Frustrated, I jigged it back and forth, turning harder. The key was too small to get a solid grip on. I squeezed down and gave it a really good twist.'
p547
aS"For a second I thought it was turning, but then I realized I'd bent the key. I'd come close to snapping it in half."
p548
aS"I pulled it gingerly from the lock, staring at it in disappointment. Well, shit. There wouldn't be any hiding this from him now. It was bent nearly in half. I slipped it into my back pocket as I tried to think what to do."
p549
aS'In between the little noises I made, the taps and scratches and breaths, the silence almost smothered me.\n\n_Try the other key._'
p550
aS'It slid in easy too, and when I gently twisted this one, it turned. I rotated it through a full three sixty before I heard a second snick.\n\nI pulled at the fridge handle and the door swung open, cold air and yellow light wafting out.'
p551
aS"I wasn't sure what I expected to see (_frozen heads_, the part of my brain still traumatized by horror movies suggested) so it took a moment of blinking in confusion to realize the fridge was empty."
p552
aS"There weren't even any shelves other than the one above the crisper drawers on the bottom, though the walls had notches where they should go. But no food. A butter dish and condiment nooks in the door, unused.\n\nThere was nothing in there."
p553
aS'Except---frowning, I bent down, shining the light inside. The fridge was _deep_. It went back a good six feet. And there was something on the back wall.'
p554
aS'The inside of another fridge door. Condiment nooks. Another butter dish.\n\n_What the hell?_'
p555
aS'Feeling foolish, I clambered inside, flashlight bumping against the plastic floor above two pairs of crisper drawers, one facing in, one facing out. They held my weight.'
p556
aS'I shuffled forward, hunched over (there was less than five feet of vertical space) and pushed the inner door. No give. I pushed harder, remembering stories about kids stuck in fridges, but still nothing. _Is this one locked too?_'
p557
aS"I searched for a keyhole, but didn't see one. _Which makes sense, if it's on the outside._ I turned back to confirm, and yes, the door I'd come through had no sign of a lock on its inner surface."
p558
aS'The logo on the plastic butter compartment said Whirlpool.'
p559
aS"A thought popped into my head: _What if it's like an airlock?_ This made no kind of logical sense, but seemed compelling. Only one door open at a time, otherwise you'd let all the cold air out. I almost giggled, then stopped myself, afraid."
p560
aS'_What am I doing?_'
p561
aS"I decided to try it. Why not? Nothing made sense, so maybe this would, for lack of any better ideas. Turning awkwardly, I reached for the door I'd come through with the hand holding the flashlight to pull it shut."
p562
aS"It wasn't designed to be pulled from the inside, but I managed to get a grip on a condiment shelf and swung it firmly towards me."
p563
aS'As the door slammed shut two things happened, both terrifying in different ways. First, there were two snicks, one from the door in front of me and one behind.'
p564
aS'Second, I lost my grip on the flashlight, and it tumbled out of my hands, hit the hard shelf underneath me with a crack, and went out.'
p565
aS"Cold terror flushed through me. I felt for the light, grabbed it and shook it, pressed the button on and off. Nothing happened. I pushed the door in front of me but it didn't give at all."
p566
aS"I slammed into it hard with my whole body, panicking, the rounded edge of a plastic shelf jabbing into my cheekbone, but the door didn't budge."
p567
aS"_Because it's locked_, I told myself, mind whirling. _But the one behind you is open, now._ I twisted around, facing the back of the fridge as near I could tell, the second door."
p568
aS'But the thought of opening that door in pitch blackness, a door leading into complete unknown, opening it blind and crawling out into darkness, was terrifying. I stayed frozen, caught between fears: staying there or moving forward.'
p569
aS'Finally some combination of claustrophobia and visions of my air running out triumphed over my fear of the unknown.'
p570
aS'Trying to keep my breathing calm, I unscrewed the end of the flashlight by feel, dumped out the old batteries, and one at a time replaced them with the fresh ones duct-taped to its sides. I held my breath and turned it on.'
p571
aS'Blessed light flooded the tiny chamber.'
p572
aS'Anxious to escape, I crab-walked forward till my outstretched hand touched the other door. Before I could stop to think, I kept moving forward, pushing my weight against it.'
p573
aS'The door opened easily. Stumbling on cramped knees, I spilled out of the fridge and staggered upright, shining my light around warily. But what I saw confused me even more.\n\nIt was the same room.'
p574
aS'I frowned, mind working, flashing the light over every surface like a brush that might paint sense into what I was seeing.'
p575
aS"It was the same kitchen---same ovens, same green cabinets, same improbably-adjacent concrete pool. Not a mirror image, or a slightly different design: it was the same room I'd just left."
p576
aS'The only difference was the fridge was on the opposite wall.\n\nLike it had connected through the wall to an identical room on the other side.'
p577
aS'Dizzy.'
p578
aS"I took a few steps forward, shined the light over the edge of the pool. Same ladder, same door, although it was shut. Had I shut it behind me this time? I'd been in a hurry. I couldn't remember.\n\nI turned back to the fridge, and froze."
p579
aS'The door had swung shut behind me.'
p580
aS"I pulled on the handle, but it didn't budge. Locked."
p581
aS"Shit. Where was the key? I'd left it in the lock on the other side. But the other one, the one I'd bent, the one that didn't fit, was still in my pocket."
p582
aS'I pulled it out again to frown at it, knowing somehow what would happen before I tried it. Sure enough, when I slipped the bent key into the lock and turned it, this time it rotated easily and the door swung open.'
p583
aS'Different key. Different lock. _Different door._\n\nDifferent room.'
p584
aS'I shut and locked it again, shaking my head.'
p585
aS'I had to see. I climbed down the ladder, dropped onto the concrete. I opened the door onto the doorless hallway.'
p586
aS"A wave of d\xc3\xa9j\xc3\xa0 vu hit me as I looked down it. It was the same hall I'd passed through minutes before---but I knew it couldn't be. I'd crawled out the other side of the fridge."
p587
aS"This wasn't the same place, and yet it had that ineffable tang of familiar places, the twinge that tells you _I've been here before_."
p588
aS'As I walked down the hallway, I looked for some distinguishing feature to confirm this intuition: but the decor was, as always, so bland that nothing stood out. It could have been any basement hallway anywhere.'
p589
aS'When I hit the stairs back up to the eight-sided room, though, something went wrong.'
p590
aS"I'd stopped without meaning to, clutching the banister, foot on the first step. I looked up the stairs, and a faint twinge of vertigo brushed me. Or not vertigo, exactly. It's hard to describe."
p591
aS"It wasn't quite premonition, a sensation, a tingling, an insight. It wasn't like knowing or feeling at all.\n\nSomething inside me between emotion and intuition just didn't want to go back up there."
p592
aS"Like that sense you get before eating spoiled food, even if you haven't consciously smelled anything sour. Like this is going to be bad for you.\n\nLike you're going to regret it."
p593
aS'When Bradley had outed us both in high school the aftermath had been ugly, in more ways than one. My house started getting egged once or twice a week. Sometimes it was worse than eggs.'
p594
aS"One day I came home from school and someone had drawn a red chalk outline on our driveway, like at a murder scene. Next to it they'd written _your next queer_."
p595
aS"I got the hose and a brush and scrubbed it out fast, wanting it gone before mom got home from work, because she'd already moved me to a new school and I was afraid if she saw the chalk outline, the message,"
p596
aS"she'd move us to a whole new state, have to quit her job and leave behind her friends and my sister's too, both of them giving up everything because of me, and I couldn't stand the thought of that."
p597
aS"I think that was the first time I really understood that some people weren't just grossed out by gay people, or morally offended. They wanted us dead. That was how wrong they thought we were."
p598
aS"To know just existing could make people feel that way about you, to realize that this was the world you'd have to live in, to keep growing up in. If you could."
p599
aS'The creeping feeling I felt now was like that. An existential wrongness. And it was getting stronger. Like a light from around a distant corner, growing brighter.'
p600
aS'I listened, motionless, but heard nothing. The quiet pressed me.'
p601
aS'_What am I going to do? Go back?_\n\nNo.'
p602
aS'Taking a deep breath, I made an impulsive decision. A few paces back was a door, and without stopping to think I pulled it open. The room inside was crammed with furniture under sheets.'
p603
aS'On a normal day this might have scared the piss out of me, but this feeling of wrongness was getting so strong I would have run straight into a room full of oversized spiders rather than stay in that hallway any longer.'
p604
aS'I slipped in and shut the door behind me, quietly---that felt important---and ran to the far end of the room. Spotting something sofa-shaped, I lifted the edge of the sheet that covered it and half-crawled, half-dived inside.'
p605
aS"Flipping onto my back, I smoothed the sheet, held my hand over the flashlight---I couldn't bear to turn it off---and held my breath."
p606
aS'The feeling had diminished when I ran across the room, but now was growing again. I was trembling. I tried not to breathe, to relax my face as if doing so would open my ears wider, let me hear fainter sounds.'
p607
aS'It was deathly quiet. All I could hear was my heartbeat.\n\nThe top of my hand glowed a dull red as the flashlight beam lit up bones and the dark veins between them.'
p608
aS"The feeling reached an unbearable crescendo, and held there sustained. I was shivering and couldn't stop. It was wrongness, wrongness on every level, filling up my body. I wanted it to go away more than anything."
p609
aS'I thought I heard something move in the hallway outside. Scuffing the carpet, maybe.\n\nThen, mercifully, the feeling started to drain away.'
p610
aS"I let out a breath, then took in another. With each one I felt more in balance, an equilibrium I'd never thought to appreciate until now. In another minute, all that was left was me: coated in sweat, crashing off adrenaline, but all right."
p611
aS'And yeah, it took fifteen minutes to muster the courage to lift the sheet and walk back across that room. Now that my regular instincts were back, the thought of what might be under all those other sheets was fucking terrifying.'
p612
aS"* * *\n\nWhen I'd recovered, I hurried across the room, out into the hall, and back up the stairs."
p613
aS'My brain had gone numb: I let myself feel like I was retracing my steps, but another part of me knew I moved through different halls and rooms, on the wrong side of the fridge.'
p614
aS"But going back would mean following the direction that ugly feeling had drifted---and I couldn't do that."
p615
aS'So I climbed the stairs to the octagon room, through the identical hallways back, and up the second stairs to the lighted upper levels, everything exactly as it should have been.\n\nWhen I saw the coffee stain, though, I stopped.'
p616
aS"It was right where Niko had spilled it on our first trip down, where the coffee had sloshed as he'd forced open the sticky door."
p617
aS"It was the same hallway. But I couldn't explain how."
p618
aS'What had happened? My brain whirred, trying to manufacture sense.'
p619
aS'What I finally decided was this: I must have gotten turned around in the dark fridge. Banging the inside of the door, trying to force it open, I somehow moved the fridge, pushed it across the kitchen to the opposite wall.'
p620
aS"When I came out, it was through the other door, but into the same room. And I must have gotten confused about the keys: maybe I hadn't turned the first one the right way when I tried it, that was all."
p621
aS"I couldn't honestly convince myself of this.\n\n_It's the same coffee stain._"
p622
aS'I felt superimposed. It had to be the same hallway, and yet it had to be a different one. This was the same stain, and yet I was a ten-minute walk from where Niko had spilled his coffee.'
p623
aS"I kept going. I made it back to the big room, looking just as I'd left it, and climbed the final stairs gingerly. But my room was waiting for me at the top, nothing out of place: my records, my textbooks, my dirty laundry."
p624
aS"That settled that. Somehow, I'd come back the same way I went in. But I felt deflated, unresolved, like the last fifty pages of the book had been left out. _And then he: The End._"
p625
aS'I shut the bed behind me more firmly than necessary. I considered nailing it shut but settled for piling some heavy boxes on top of it.'
p626
aS"It had been maybe an hour since I'd left. Niko was still passed out on the couch in our front room."
p627
aS'I curled up on the next couch over and, despite being so keyed up I could barely think, dropped into sleep.'
p628
aS'* * *\n\nI woke some time later to Niko shaking my shoulder, and sat up, bleary-eyed. It was still dark outside.\n\n"Go to bed," he was saying, "it\'s late."'
p629
aS"I yawned. The trip Downstairs seemed like a dream, coming back in bits and pieces. I snuck a glance at the corner of the table where he'd emptied his pockets, but his stuff was gone. Did he notice I'd taken the keys?"
p630
aS"Shit. I'd have to tell him."
p631
aS'"Hey man," I said, dreading this. "You remember earlier when you pulled your shit out to get your phone, and left it on the table?"'
p632
aS'He blinked. "Um. No."'
p633
aS'He\'d been pretty drunk. I pressed on. "We were about halfway through finishing that bottle." The vodka bottle was about a quarter full. I frowned. Hadn\'t we killed it?'
p634
aS'Shaking my head, I pressed on. "Look. What I\'m trying to say is, I took the keys. I\'m sorry. I just wanted to know if you\'d found something down there. Why you hadn\'t told me.'
p635
aS'I went but there was nothing there, and I got turned around and... anyway, it doesn\'t matter. I screwed up and I lost one key, and uh, kind of damaged the other."'
p636
aS'It sounded so stupid as I said it, and I hated myself, both for stealing from him and for failing to discover anything useful with them. "I\'m an idiot, man, and I\'m sorry.'
p637
aS'But look, if you tell me where you found them, maybe we could figure something out, and talk about what\'s going on, and everything?"'
p638
aS"Niko was frowning, but didn't seem angry. Maybe this wasn't going to be a big deal after all.\n\nHe sat down on the floor next to me, a serious look on his face."
p639
aS'"Orion," he said, "exactly what fucking keys are you talking about?"'
p640
aS'Chapter 5\n\nThe next few minutes unspooled with growing panic, like a harpoon in a speared sea monster diving deeper and deeper.'
p641
aS"Niko said he'd never found any keys. And as I tried to piece together the evening, to backtrace what had happened, little details kept failing to add up. The vodka bottle."
p642
aS'The lyrics: now he agreed with me, was baffled that I thought he could possibly get them wrong. He pulled out his phone and showed me the last text from his ex: four months ago.'
p643
aS'Despite these discrepancies, something felt right about the way we discussed them. We were back in sync again. The strained awkwardness and stunted conversations of the last week were gone.'
p644
aS"It felt like he'd been away on a trip and we were catching up again, despite the fact that we'd been seeing each other all week."
p645
aS"But when I told him where I'd been that night, about the fridge and the keys, it was like I'd punched him in the face."
p646
aS'He bolted up, took a few paces, then collapsed into a chair, stricken. "Oh, shit," he kept saying. "Oh shit oh shit oh shit."'
p647
aS"He wouldn't say anything else until I poured him another shot of vodka---the vodka we'd already finished, goddammit---and then the story started breaking out of him in dangerous pieces."
p648
aS'"Okay, so. The night of the party." He looked drained. "I didn\'t feel like talking, you know, to other humans. So I went exploring. Had a vague thought like maybe I\'d find something interesting to bring back up and show you."'
p649
aS'He ran a shaky hand through his kinked hair. "But something..." He swallowed. "Something happened, okay? And I got to the pool room and I couldn\'t go back the same way." He waved a hand at my raised eyebrow.'
p650
aS'"Let me just finish telling this, okay?"'
p651
aS"He wouldn't say what had happened, but it made him change course, and eventually he found himself approaching the pool room door from the other direction."
p652
aS'He climbed the ladder into the kitchen, but when he got there found the fridge not only unlocked, but open---the outer door, at least.'
p653
aS"He'd done the same thing I had: climbed inside, pulled the door shut, lost his light, pushed the other door open---and climbed out with the same spatial confusion I'd had."
p654
aS'I told him my theory about knocking the fridge around, but he shook his head. "No, I don\'t think so. When my light went out, I was pretty deliberate with my motions, exactly because I didn\'t want to get turned around.'
p655
aS'I barely jostled the thing. And there\'s something else that makes me think..."'
p656
aS'He swallowed, licked his lips. For a long minute, he couldn\'t meet my eye. Then he grabbed my knee, as if to steady himself, looked over at me. Looked hard. "Ryan. Man. This is going to sound crazy. But listen, okay? This place.'
p657
aS'This house." He looked around furtively, as if we were someplace dangerous and not the living room of our college crash pad. "We\'re not where we used to be. _This is a different place._"'
p658
aS'"Step off," I said, rejecting this at once. "It\'s one thing to say there\'s a couple mirrored hallways down there, but there\'s not a whole different house up here.'
p659
aS'There aren\'t clones of our goddamn roommates, a different street and sky and..."'
p660
aS'I trailed off, because he was staring at me, miserable. I realized this was exactly what he thought was happening.'
p661
aS'"Look," I said, worried and afraid, "let\'s go back right now. I\'ll show you the coffee stain. That proves it."'
p662
aS'"I\'m not going back down there." He pulled back. "I\'ve been too damn terrified to even think about it, after what I..." He bit his lip, looked away. Took the last swig of vodka.'
p663
aS'Tingles crawled down my neck. "What you saw? Well, what was it?"'
p664
aS"He didn't answer for a while. I thought he was trying to remember at first, and then maybe that he was trying to forget."
p665
aS'Finally, defeated, he told me. "On my way down. Before I got there. I started feeling... off. Like something was wrong."'
p666
aS'He stopped, trembling. Phantom insects crawled up my back. What did he see to rattle him this bad?'
p667
aS'"That long hallway. Without any doors. I was walking down it, and I saw another light."'
p668
aS'I sat rigid. "What the fuck?"'
p669
aS'"I kept walking," he went on, not looking at me. "I didn\'t want to turn my back, get chased down. That sick feeling got stronger. Sharper. But I couldn\'t stop walking. Couldn\'t turn around."'
p670
aS'He took a deep breath. "The light got closer. It was someone with a flashlight. They were walking toward me the same way I was walking toward them. I couldn\'t see their face. I just kept walking.'
p671
aS'I kind of hugged the right wall and they hugged the left. The flashlight was right in my face. I couldn\'t see anything until we were only a few steps apart."'
p672
aS"He met my gaze at last, forehead wet with cold sweat, like he was reliving that queasy sensation. My own stomach twisted. I couldn't breathe."
p673
aS'"Ry," he said, "I passed myself. I walked right past another me with another flashlight, who looked as sick and fucked up as I did. And we both kept walking. We didn\'t stop.'
p674
aS'I made it to the pool room, climbed the ladder, and went right through that fucking fridge to get farther away. And there is no fucking way I\'m going back down there again."'
p675
aS'I swallowed. "Dude. It was dark. You were messed up. Maybe you saw someone else down there, but what you\'re saying, man. It\'s impossible."'
p676
aS'"Irrational." A hollow laugh. "Things are different here. On this side. I\'ll show you. What\'s the smallest bill you\'ve got in your wallet?"'
p677
aS'"Uh, I don\'t know." Taken aback, I pulled it out, riffled through the smaller bills. He smiled grimly at one of them, snatched it, held it up.'
p678
aS'"Better hold onto this. Because no one here\'s ever heard of one."'
p679
aS'"What are you talking about?" I said, annoyed.\n\nAnd over the next hour, he showed me.'
p680
aS'We pored through the dusty encyclopedia in our front foyer. We combed the magazines sitting in the house, dragged out Monopoly.'
p681
aS'We fired up the Internet (all GeoCities and tedium in those days) and found pictures of cash registers, government websites, coin collectors talking about the history of currency.'
p682
aS'According to everything we could find, the US Government had never, at any point in its history, issued a three dollar bill as legal tender.'
p683
aS'We stared at the one from my wallet with growing unease. Buchanan\'s familiar portrait stared back, implacable. Niko tapped the portrait\'s chin. "That right there might be the only one that exists in this place. Wherever we are."'
p684
aS'* * *\n\nWe cobbled together a theory out of guesswork and dreams.'
p685
aS'If Downstairs had two sides---two versions, or halves, or whatever---then Niko had passed into the other one the night of the party, through the unlocked fridge.'
p686
aS'The Niko I saw stumbling out of the hall that night, sick and wanting sleep, was the wrong Niko. A different Niko. The one my Niko had passed in the hall.'
p687
aS"And that Niko didn't quite fit in. Everything was a little off about him, and from his perspective, I suppose, about me."
p688
aS"But that Niko had found two keys. We had no idea where he'd found them."
p689
aS"But if he'd passed through the fridge with one of them---"
p690
aS'and here I will compress the part where we opened another bottle of vodka rather than accept the ridiculousness of this garbage fairy tale premise where a magical Frigidaire is a gateway between worlds,'
p691
aS'slept it off,'
p692
aS'suffered through ugly hangovers the next day, and reconvened late in the afternoon with some Aspirin---if the other Niko came through the fridge just before my Niko had,'
p693
aS'that could explain why my Niko had found it unlocked and open, was able to pass through.'
p694
aS"And earlier---if we followed this chain of logic---I'd been drinking from a different vodka bottle, in a different house, with that other Niko. The one with the keys."
p695
aS"I'd stolen them and passed through to this side of Downstairs---the wrong side---and maybe some other me had been doing the same thing."
p696
aS'I only avoided him by my sudden detour, when I sensed something wrong up ahead and ducked into the side room with the sheet-covered furniture, to let him pass by.'
p697
aS'And now we were both in the wrong house, on the opposite side from where we\'d started.\n\n"And both of them are on the wrong side, too," Niko said, still wincing from the hangover.'
p698
aS'I licked my lips, head also still spinning, wondering if it would be okay to take two more Aspirin. Or four more. "But these other two, if they exist." I still couldn\'t quite surrender to this madness.'
p699
aS'"They could come back any time they wanted, right? And so could we."'
p700
aS'"Because the key\'s still in the lock on their side." Niko frowned. "And you\'ve got the one for this side. Both keys are back where they should be now. One for us and one for them."\n\n"Unless there are two keys for this side too."'
p701
aS'"No. You said the first one you tried didn\'t work, even though it looked the same? I think there\'s exactly two keys. One for each side. The other me ended up with both, somehow.'
p702
aS'I guess if he found one and went through, he\'d know right where to look for the second."\n\nWe stared at each other.'
p703
aS'"What does that mean?" I asked.'
p704
aS'"I have no fucking idea. But shit, man, I\'m glad you\'re here." He ran a hand through his curls, face pale. "I seriously wasn\'t handling this on my own. This whole last week, things weren\'t right.'
p705
aS'_You_ weren\'t right, and I couldn\'t stand that, man. I was going crazy without you. Doubting everything, you know how I get. Doubting who I even was. But this, this is..."'
p706
aS'He waved his hand back and forth between the two of us, then knocked it on the table. "You get me. We\'re tight. Yeah? In it together, I mean. It\'s good. I\'m glad."'
p707
aS"I didn't say anything, but I didn't have to. I felt the same way and he knew it."
p708
aS"I slept in his room that night, in a sleeping bag beside his bed. He didn't want to be alone. I'd kind of wanted some time to process everything but I didn't protest too much. I liked being his anchor."
p709
aS"He kept us both up late talking about random bullshit, rambling. It was okay. Everything was upside down. Old comforts couldn't hurt."
p710
aS"* * *\n\nWe slept in the next day. Call me a coward, but buried in my sleeping bag I could pretend I wasn't in the wrong universe."
p711
aS"Things were definitely wrong. Now that I was looking, I couldn't deny it. Familiar people acted strange in a way you couldn't put your finger on. Colors seemed indefinably different shades."
p712
aS'A vague sense of off-ness suffused everything, like a movie with the sound a frame out of sync.'
p713
aS"After looking more closely, things were off about my room. There was an unfamiliar dress shirt on a hanger. My copy of Samuel Delany's _Dhalgren_ was missing, along with all the other books of his I'd discovered after reading that one."
p714
aS"It wasn't quite my room, I realized. It was someone else's."
p715
aS"It was mostly little things, so we grasped at each quantitative difference, each change we could pin down. One night one of our housemates kept saying something I didn't understand."
p716
aS'She was going on about getting a parking ticket and kept saying it was the "fourth fucking time" it had happened.\n\n"What\'s that word you\'re saying?"'
p717
aS'"Fucking," she clarified, unhelpfully.'
p718
aS'"No," I said. "Count up in ordinals. You know first, second..."'
p719
aS'She blinked at me. "First, second, third, fourth, fifth."'
p720
aS'Fourth. Instead of fourd.\n\nThings were different here.'
p721
aS'We didn\'t find too many obvious changes. Stop signs were red octagons now instead of red circles. The housemates now said "get on the freeway" instead of "get on the parkway."'
p722
aS"Usually we weren't quite sure whether something had actually changed, or we were losing our goddamn minds."
p723
aS"We danced around it for a while, but finally the phrase came out: parallel universes. But it didn't really satisfy. Why these two universes in particular, out of a supposedly infinite number?"
p724
aS'Why were they connected via a series of poorly decorated basement rooms and linked together by a refrigerator, of all things?'
p725
aS"At one point, feeling overwhelmed, I called home---not to tell mom what was happening because I didn't want her to freak, just to hear her voice---but the answering machine said they were on vacation till the end of the month."
p726
aS'This was annoying both because I hadn\'t heard about any long vacation, and because "we" presumably meant her and my sister, and for some reason I hadn\'t been invited, which made me feel even more out of place and abandoned.'
p727
aS'I was three hours away, not on a different planet.'
p728
aS"Feeling rejected, I went record shopping, adding a couple hundred dollars to my already terrifying credit card debt in exchange for a small stack of LPs. Lately I'd gotten obsessed with sci-fi audio book recordings."
p729
aS'I found a few treasures at my usual haunts: Leonard Nimoy reading Ray Bradbury, and a six-record set of one of the Dune novels, read by Frank Herbert himself, still shrink-wrapped.'
p730
aS"More and more I only bought stuff in its original wrapping, unopened, sleeves protected from scuffs and wear marks, the records inside unplayed and undamaged, which is how I'd keep them."
p731
aS'Bradley had been the one who got me into records.'
p732
aS"I was a cassette tape kid and a Discman high schooler, but he'd hooked me on the sound of LPs, the joys of flipping through those big bold album covers in record stores;"
p733
aS'of lying on your back blissing out to the singular magic of some rare recording or old favorite spun roaring back to life, twenty-two minutes at a time.'
p734
aS"After what happened in the cafeteria I didn't talk to him for a long time. He kept trying to see me. Calling the house, throwing pebbles at my window late at night. I ignored it all."
p735
aS"I was so angry at him, for taking something from me I couldn't quite encircle or define: more than my coming out, but all the changes inside me that would have led up to it, too. For putting me in danger, and my friends, my family."
p736
aS"He didn't give up. He left long, rambling messages on our answering machine, slipped love letters under the door."
p737
aS"He was waiting outside the house one day when I walked home from my new school and there on the front porch, wearing our backpacks, I told him I didn't want to see him any more and broke his heart."
p738
aS"He begged me. He pleaded. He screamed and then apologized for screaming; he groveled, he cried. He told me he couldn't live without me. He said I'd never find anyone who'd love me like he did."
p739
aS"He said if I threw away what we had because of the bigots and bullies I'd be letting them win."
p740
aS"When my little sister got home he started begging and pleading with her to talk some sense into me, and when he grabbed her arm and started shouting at her too, that's when I hit him."
p741
aS'He kept calling and writing and dropping by the house until my mom got the police involved. After that I never saw him again.'
p742
aS'Probably it was because of what happened with Bradley that I got so guarded with my friendships later on. I kept a polite distance from most people, and almost everyone I met in college stayed an acquaintance, not a friend.'
p743
aS"It was as if I'd lost the knack of getting close to people, of letting them in. Connecting."
p744
aS"Niko broke through that, somehow, became the first close friend I'd had in years, and even though I tried not to cling too hard, eventually I figured out why it had been so difficult not to. He'd been clinging back."
p745
aS'We stayed close, maybe inevitably now that we were the only matching pair in this entire universe. It felt easy to be closer to him, for us both to need each other. It felt right. A relief from the wrongness all around us.'
p746
aS'He thought my airlock idea had legs. Downstairs was made from house-stuff: hallways and empty rooms and appliances. A fridge was one of the few devices in that context that could maintain a seal.'
p747
aS"It was a cute concept except it didn't actually explain anything.\n\nIt took a long time to convince him we needed to go back down."
p748
aS'"Maybe we can just stay here, and they can stay there," he said. "So everything\'s off a little. So what? It felt way more wrong to get close to..." He waved a hand. "Him. Whoever. My handsome twin.'
p749
aS'So maybe we should leave well enough alone. Brick the fucker up and never look back."\n\nThen the headaches started.'
p750
aS'They were odd headaches. Not severe. A tinge of nausea and dizziness, like stepping off one of those fairground rides that whirls you around, and only a very distant pain. They came and went. But I took them as an ominous sign.'
p751
aS"Niko said he'd been getting them all week. Oh. And they'd been getting stronger."
p752
aS"So the headaches more than anything convinced us. We had to go back down, try to get back through. Or maybe there were other points of connection. We'd barely started exploring. There was so much left."
p753
aS'But first we had to solve what Niko called the Mere Paradox. He threw a spoon at me when I said this back to him.'
p754
aS'"No, smart-ass. A _Mirror_ Paradox. We\'re obviously in this creepy weird sync with them." We were in his room with the door shut, and he was pacing the two-and-a-half steps of cleared floor while I lay on his bed, thinking. "Example.'
p755
aS'Me and the other Niko both went exploring on the same night. The other side, the other house, they were having a party that night too. We both saw that. The decor, uh, such as it was, was the same on both sides, or close enough.'
p756
aS'He and I were so synced up that we got to the fridge only minutes apart. He beat me, so he came through first, and then we passed in the hall."'
p757
aS'He stopped pacing, shuddered, and drummed his fingers on a bulky MIDI keyboard propped up against a wall gathering dust. "Two. A week later, both pairs of us end up getting drunk off vodka on the same night.'
p758
aS"Oh, there's these little differences---one side finishes the bottle, the other doesn't, and this me didn't get a certain text message that night---but both versions of you decide to go exploring."
p759
aS'Again, you get to the pool room only minutes apart. For the most part it\'s like we\'re staying in a kind of lockstep, despite the superficial differences."\n\n"Your conclusion, professor."'
p760
aS'"If we go down to explore, they will too. We meet in the middle, and bam." He shook his head. "Exactly what we don\'t want to happen." He saw I was still confused, so he scribbled two arrows on his whiteboard, pointed right at each other.'
p761
aS'"The fridge is the connection point. The only way each pair of us can get back, so far as we know. But if we go back there, so will they. It\'s like we\'re trapped on two sides of a mirror.'
p762
aS'We each want to touch it, but we can\'t do it at the same time."\n\n"Would it really be so bad?"'
p763
aS'He glared down at me. "You don\'t trust that feeling? I got a lot closer than you, and man, it was the worst.'
p764
aS'I don\'t know what was causing it or why, but every part of my body was screaming something was wrong, was sick, was going to harm me." He sighed and flopped down next to me.'
p765
aS'"So if we can\'t get close to each other, but trying to cross through will bring us together, then what do we do?"'
p766
aS'"Okay, so we explore at random." I sat up. "Every branch, we roll dice. Even if the others are in sync and pick the same time to explore, they\'ll go down different paths."'
p767
aS'He shook his head. "I think the lockstep runs deeper than that. Even randomness could be part of it. The coffee stain. Remember? We both passed the one on this side, coming out. That\'s what made you assume you were in the same place.'
p768
aS'Because it was identical, right? If both versions of me spilled coffee and both made exactly the same stain, I bet dice would fall the same way too."'
p769
aS'"How do we know it\'s identical? Did you really stop and look that close?"'
p770
aS'That got him. Niko would jump off a bridge to win an argument. A few minutes later we were headed back down the stairs, keeping up a forced light banter.'
p771
aS"It helped that the coffee stain was close to the surface, and far enough away from the fridge that even if the others went down at the same time, to look at their stain, we'd be nowhere near each other."
p772
aS'No one had cleaned up after the party---in fact, the other housemates had stopped coming down here at all, inexplicably---so there were still Christmas lights and red plastic cups strewn around the big room. Weirdly comforting.'
p773
aS'We retraced our first trip through the upper hallways to the coffee stain, and got down on hands and knees to study it. I immediately felt foolish.'
p774
aS'"This won\'t prove anything. We never looked at the original this close." I shrugged. "I don\'t know. It looks the same to me."'
p775
aS'"But exactly the same?" Niko bent closer, excited. "No, I don\'t think so. I don\'t remember this trail of droplets off to the side here. Do you?"'
p776
aS'We argued about it for a few minutes, but it was like grabbing soap in a bathtub.'
p777
aS"I'd read enough textbooks about memory and perception to know neither of us could accurately recall specifics of the other stain---it was weeks since we'd seen it and the details hadn't seemed important at the time."
p778
aS'I got up, shaking my head. "What is this even meant to prove? Does it matter if they\'re identical or not?"'
p779
aS'"It matters," he said emphatically, "because if it\'s exactly the same then the two sides are in total lockstep. We can\'t do anything different from them and they can\'t do anything different from us.'
p780
aS'But if the stains are different---even just a little---then there\'s a chance to break out of the pattern. Do something unique. That could be huge."'
p781
aS'"But we know we\'re not exactly in sync," I said. "For one thing, they somehow found keys down here. We never did that. They know things we don\'t, which means they\'re factoring that knowledge into their plans right now."'
p782
aS'"Like where they found them in the first place," he said, rubbing his temples. "Right."'
p783
aS'We sat in the hall for a minute in glum silence. I stared at the coffee stain, like it was an inkblot that would resolve into something sensible if I could make my mind work the right way.'
p784
aS'"There\'s other differences," I said. "When I went down, I felt like something was wrong, and I went and hid like a baby. The other version of me didn\'t do that. We did different things."'
p785
aS'"Yeah," he said, closing his eyes. "I\'m actually worried about that."\n\n"You were just saying you wanted us to be unique."'
p786
aS'He rubbed his forehead. Maybe he was getting another headache. "The two sides are nearly identical, as far as we can tell. The two versions of us are nearly identical too. So far, at least. But I don\'t know.'
p787
aS'Maybe if we start acting different, if we diverge too far..."\n\n"What?"'
p788
aS'He shrugged. "Don\'t know. Just a thought. Probably garbage, never mind."'
p789
aS'I closed my eyes and leaned my head back against the wall. "I\'m late for work."'
p790
aS'"Gotta make rent," he muttered. "Wouldn\'t want to get evicted now."'
p791
aS'* * *\n\nNiko was scared. He stayed close to me almost all the time, hanging out in my room, by the TV, wherever I was.'
p792
aS'This was a familiar pattern, actually: whenever he got overwhelmed he made me his full-time validator, babbling his interior monologue, running every decision big and small by me, ending most sentences with "Right?" or "Yeah?"'
p793
aS"It was like outsourcing his ego. I let him do it, like I always did, because it felt good to have him need me that much. But I felt guilty, too, because it couldn't be healthy."
p794
aS"At least it kept his mood from worsening. At low ebbs he'd slow down, stop moving: his face would go slack like the strings holding it up had been cut."
p795
aS"He'd been known to lock himself in his room and not come out for days, at least not when anyone could see: not eating, not sleeping or maybe doing nothing but. He'd stop talking even to me."
p796
aS"I'd bring him food and after knocking and joking and cajoling would have to leave it outside his door. The next afternoon it would still be there, crawling with flies, untouched."
p797
aS"Eventually he'd emerge grinning like a cold-blooded reptile hit by a sunbeam; he'd shower and do laundry and throw out empty liquor bottles and clean up the dirty dishes and pretend like nothing had happened."
p798
aS"But he knew he couldn't fool me.\n\nSo I kept him talking,\nand our half-assed theories began to crystallize into a plan."
p799
aS'We rounded up a bunch of dice, some tarot and playing cards, loose change, a dreidel, and a stack of books, and devised a procedure---a ridiculously complicated procedure lasting almost an hour---to end up with two numbers,'
p800
aS'after several dozen iterations: the first between one and twenty-four, and the second between one and sixty.'
p801
aS'An hour, and a minute.'
p802
aS'The theory was that even if both sides were so close even randomness tended to turn out the same, if we stacked that randomness on top of itself, compounding chance on chance, it might be a wedge to split that sameness apart.'
p803
aS'Niko showed me a tiny video on his computer about strange attractors, said this was chaos theory in action, the butterfly effect. Whatever. We were making wild guesses.'
p804
aS"But the hope was that even if the other versions of us were doing the exact same thing---following an identical procedure---their numbers would drift apart and they'd end up generating a completely different time."
p805
aS'Which would allow each pair of us to pass through without crossing paths.'
p806
aS'So we had a plan. We just needed a time.'
p807
aS'* * *\n\n"In hindsight," Niko said, throwing back the last of the coffee and smacking his lips, "maybe we should have put a range on the fucking numbers. Dear god. I have to be at work in five hours."'
p808
aS"It was just after three in the morning, and we were prepping to go down. The time we'd generated was 3:41. We hoped for their sake the guys on the other side got something more reasonable."
p809
aS'Niko was in a rough mood, and it wasn\'t just the time of day. His old jock friends had been ragging him about not hanging out. ("I have to pretend sports bloopers are funny, Ry. It\'s horrible.")'
p810
aS"Later he'd gotten a call from one or both of his parents about how his degree was progressing, which had not gone well."
p811
aS'He spent the rest of the day in his room with the door shut blaring loud music and, apparently, watching a _Friends_ marathon. Every time I listened at his door I kept hearing Joey say "How _you_ doin\'?" Laugh track.'
p812
aS'Maybe he was just watching the same episode on repeat. Late that night I knocked again and reminded him we had a three a.m. date. A long and mournful stream of cuss words came muffled through the door.'
p813
aS'After an ominous silence he opened it, looking bleak. "Whose stupid idea was this again?" he asked, then grimly set his alarm.'
p814
aS"We'd planned a quick trip in and out, to minimize the chance of overlapping times. Once we passed through and got back up to the surface, our surface, we'd leave the house and stay away until the next day."
p815
aS"The campus library stayed open all night and if you had a book in your lap they wouldn't usually hassle you for sleeping. The next morning, we'd come back home, the headaches would be gone, and everything would be back to normal."
p816
aS'It made sense, except we were making it all up and had no idea if any of this would work or if we were playing make-believe.'
p817
aS'Swinging up the bed did feel ominous now, though. I noticed for the first time that it creaked. Stupid.'
p818
aS'We were girded up with supplies even though it was supposed to be a quick trip---three flashlights each, water bottles, even granola bars.'
p819
aS'Niko had a pad of yellow sticky notes and flipped the edges of it compulsively, nervous: "in case we need to mark our way," he explained.'
p820
aS"We'd never seen anything dangerous down there, exactly. We just knew something wasn't right, now. That it wasn't just a basement down there."
p821
aS'_We knew._ We knew nothing. The truth is that despite our attempts to rationalize, to explain, we were blind. Shooting in the dark. Grasping at straws from sci-fi movies and bad dreams.\n\nWe had no idea what was happening to us.'
p822
aS'We headed down, quietly so as not to wake our housemates. Once we got Downstairs, we followed the well-beaten path toward the room with the pool and the fridge.'
p823
aS'Niko was jumpy, especially when we got to the first staircase into the dark zone. Every shadow seemed ominous and he muttered suspicions at everything. "I think this door moved," or, "Someone\'s been here, I can feel it."'
p824
aS'I tried my best to keep things light, to reassure him. He started idly doodling flip-book animations of a gruesome hanging on the pad of sticky notes.'
p825
aS'On our way down the twisting stairs to the octagon room, he stopped at one landing and glanced down the hall branching off from it. With a choke, he stiffened and leapt back, gripping the flashlight like a sword.'
p826
aS'"Jesus fucking Christ," he hissed. "What the shit is that?"\n\nI looked.'
p827
aS'Way down the hallway, past the reach of the flashlight, were two tiny glints, hovering maybe four feet off the ground, deep in the darkness.'
p828
aS"My heart rate was through the roof and I couldn't breathe, but I raised my flashlight too, shined it down the hall. It revealed nothing but the glints. I felt paralyzed. But I saw how scared Niko was. How close both of us were to panic."
p829
aS'I gave him a mock salute. "Later, skater," I said, and started down the hall.'
p830
aS'"The fuck are you doing?" Niko hissed from behind me. But I kept moving. I kept walking forward, eyes fixed on the glints, willing my light to get stronger, willing those eyes to resolve into something explainable, something benign.'
p831
aS'"Shit," Niko said, and followed me. "Shit shit shit."\n\nIt only took a few more steps before we realized our mistake.'
p832
aS'The hall ended in a T-junction. About four feet off the floor was one of those fake candelabra. The glints had been our flashlights, reflecting off its dull metal sheen.'
p833
aS'I laughed; it was easy with all the relief flooding through me. "See? There\'s enough weird shit going on without jumping at shadows."'
p834
aS'Niko forced a laugh out too, but his face was still pale and tense. "How could you tell? From back there?"'
p835
aS'I shrugged. "I couldn\'t. This was the quickest way to find out."'
p836
aS'"Great. My hero. Glad you weren\'t mauled by a shadowbear." But he was smiling now for real, and looking at me with respect.'
p837
aS"_He was right. That was stupid. Bravado is exactly the wrong response to what's happening._"
p838
aS'"Let\'s hurry and get this over with." We walked back to the landing. Niko wrote "NOT THIS WAY" on a sticky note and slapped it on the wall, drawing an arrow down the hall.'
p839
aS'I added a smiley face; he grabbed the pen back and drew some demon eyebrows on it.'
p840
aS'We made it the rest of the way to the pool room without incident, and climbed the ladder.'
p841
aS'I was on edge, waiting for any signs of that sick feeling of wrongness, but nothing happened, and there were no creepy doppelg\xc3\xa4ngers waiting for us above the lip of the pool.'
p842
aS'"Okay," Niko said, clapping his hands: he was spooked too, I could tell. "Let\'s do this. You want to do the honors?"'
p843
aS'I pulled out the bent key and slipped it into the lock, turned it. It rotated with a smooth snick. I pulled the handle, and as I tugged the fridge door open past the familiar suction, the light inside came on.'
p844
aS'Niko let out a strangled gasp and bent down, staring inside the door in horror. I stood frozen, still gripping the handle, unable to process what my eyes were telling me.'
p845
aS'Because inside was no longer a vinyl-padded room and the inside of another door. Instead, we were staring down a smooth, white, rectangular tunnel, that went on and on as far as we could see.'
p846
aS'Chapter 6\n\n"What the fuck is this?" Niko hissed. I didn\'t have an answer. We stared into the bright white hallway like it was a road to heaven, or to hell.'
p847
aS"The first few feet were the same as when we'd passed through before, the same as the interior of any ordinary fridge. Vinyl walls, plastic crisper drawers below the clear floor, a tiny bright bulb in the ceiling. But it didn't end."
p848
aS'It kept going. Every few feet another little white bulb above; vinyl walls extending farther and farther; and an endless highway of clear plastic shelf for a floor, eight inches above the vinyl floor.'
p849
aS'The lines extended to a perfect vanishing point, and for as far as we could see, nothing changed.'
p850
aS'For the next few hours, we did our best to interrogate this new unwanted truth, but gained no new understanding, came no closer to reconciling it with our plans to go back through.'
p851
aS'First we threw some wadded-up sticky notes and granola bars down the tunnel. When nothing happened to them, we ventured inside.'
p852
aS'Walking was hard: the ceiling was too low to stand up straight, so you had to move forward in an awkward shuffle.'
p853
aS"We only made it a hundred feet in before we had to turn back: Niko had been looking over his shoulder every few seconds to make sure the door back out hadn't vanished while we'd turned our backs on it,"
p854
aS'and eventually bumped his head one too many times on the ceiling and had a full-on claustrophobic panic attack.'
p855
aS'We retreated, hearts racing and muscles cramping. The next hundred feet had looked just as identical, anyway.'
p856
aS'We tried locking the fridge and unlocking it again, turning the key and opening the door a dozen different ways, like it was a car with an unreliable starter you needed the right knack to handle.'
p857
aS'The door always opened on that same impossible tunnel.'
p858
aS'We tried shouting down the tunnel, or staying quiet and listening, but our voices were swallowed up and the silence stayed relentless, unbroken except for the quiet hums of the row of tiny lights.'
p859
aS'Later we got braver, tried more drastic measures: Niko had a pocketknife and we took it to the tunnel walls. Underneath the vinyl was more vinyl. We gouged out a chunk eight inches deep before giving up.'
p860
aS'The floor felt like flimsy plastic, bending a little with our weight, but no amount of vigorous stomping shattered or even cracked it.'
p861
aS'"We could get a bunch of food, mount an expedition," I suggested, half-heartedly. _It can\'t go on forever,_ I wanted to say, but couldn\'t bring myself to. He didn\'t answer.\n\nFinally, we gave up.'
p862
aS'We climbed back down the ladder to the empty pool and stepped back into the hall. I was trying to think of next steps, more plans, but my body and mind were exhausted. I turned to pull the pool door shut behind us.'
p863
aS'As I did I noticed a small yellow square was stuck to it.'
p864
aS'"Niko," I gasped, breath failing me, "oh _shit_. There\'s a note. Someone left a note."'
p865
aS'We stared at it, afraid to touch it. We saw immediately that it was the one we\'d left earlier, at the junction with the glints. "NOT THIS WAY," it said in Niko\'s handwriting.'
p866
aS'But the smiley face with the demon eyebrows looked sinister now, malevolent.\n\nThe arrow pointed toward the pool room, and the fridge.'
p867
aS'"It\'s them," Niko breathed, sagging back against the opposite wall, as far away from the note as possible. "Our doubles. They moved it. My god, Ry. They came here and moved it. They were right outside."'
p868
aS'My mind whirled. "Then that means there must be another way through. Some way for them to get here."'
p869
aS'"Maybe." He swallowed, face pale. "Or maybe there\'s something else going on. Something\'s down here with us, man. Fucking with us."\n\nWe stared at the note.'
p870
aS'_NOT THIS WAY._\n\nThe silence was almost painful.'
p871
aS'Abruptly Niko turned and started back down the hall, toward the surface, not talking, not looking back. I was right behind him.'
p872
aS'* * *\n\nWhen I was a kid I got way into swimming one year, another obsession. I started going to the rec center pool every day after school, having mom drop me off there on weekends.'
p873
aS"They had a swim program and I shot through all the rankings. Minnow, Fish, Flying Fish, Salmon, Shark, Tiger Shark. I swam. I don't recall especially enjoying it: it was just something I did, like a job."
p874
aS"Then at school one day someone asked me why I was so into it and I couldn't tell them. I could hold my breath for forever, which helped, but hardly seemed like a good reason."
p875
aS"The truth was I had no idea why I was doing it, and that terrified me. What had made me start? I couldn't remember."
p876
aS'I felt almost violated, possessed, like some outside force had tricked me into driving all my thoughts and energies into moving back and forth through lanes of water, over and over again, for months on end.'
p877
aS"I stopped not long after, in part because I was hitting puberty and changing clothes in front of other guys was becoming more and more mortifying, but I think really it was because I couldn't explain that compulsion and it scared me."
p878
aS'I felt it again, now. I wanted to stay Downstairs. Sure, I could rationalize this away: the only way back home was down here. But the real reason was that I wanted to find out what was down there, more than anything. I was driven to.'
p879
aS"Something was driving me. At least that's how it felt."
p880
aS"I didn't mention any of this to Niko. I knew if I did it might put him off exploring altogether."
p881
aS"We didn't say anything to each other on the way back, and when we climbed up through my bed and shut it, we split up. Niko went out the front door, I assumed to take a walk, without a word."
p882
aS'I lay on my bed listening to records until I got too creeped out imagining what might be underneath me, and went out to curl up on the porch swing, instead.'
p883
aS'The summer air was hot, with only the hint of a breeze, but felt infinitely better than the cold dead air down there.'
p884
aS'I tried to think of anything else, but something kept dragging my brain Downstairs, as if it was too heavy to stay on the surface with me.'
p885
aS"No matter how often I clawed my way onto other topics, Downstairs and all the things we didn't know about it dominated my thoughts.\n\nI had no idea what we should do next."
p886
aS"When Niko came back it was with a brown bag from the liquor store, and he went straight up to his room, not even looking at me. I should have stopped him but I didn't feel like talking to him either."
p887
aS"We didn't know what was going on; we didn't know how to stop it. We didn't know anything.\n\nWe might have stayed in our funk for another couple days, except something happened the next morning."
p888
aS'The local history lady had left me a voicemail at around 7:15, a solid fantasy movie and credits before I normally woke up.'
p889
aS"She'd been useless when I'd stopped by before,"
p890
aS'and her tone of voice in the message---"something a bit exciting\'s come to light about your house"---made me assume she\'d dredged up some trivia as a pretense to get me to come back and keep her company.'
p891
aS'Maybe get me to join the local history society myself. A warm-blooded young person like myself could even aspire to become treasurer.'
p892
aS'So it was a couple hours before I got around to calling her back and asking when would be a good time to come over.'
p893
aS'"Oh, come right away," she said, voice syrupy. "This really can\'t wait. Just wait till you see what I\'ve found."'
p894
aS"Not at all encouraged, I agreed to head over, and biked the mile or so to her run-down house. The visit got off to an ugly start when she asked why I hadn't brought my colored friend this time."
p895
aS'"Actually, he\'s Greek," I said through clenched teeth, and then wished I had the guts to say something else.'
p896
aS"She served me tea again, weak to the point of tastelessness, and spent so much time making small talk I'd convinced myself she hadn't found anything and this whole exercise was a waste of time."
p897
aS'Worse, she kept glancing at my pride bracelet and pursing her lips, and then pretending not to have done either.'
p898
aS'I wanted to get out of there but was too mentally exhausted to remember how social interactions were supposed to work, what niceties would bring a conversation to an end.'
p899
aS"The third or fourd time I pressed her about what she'd found, she got up with a triumphant smile and bustled out, returning a minute later with a file folder holding a few photocopies."
p900
aS'"I did some digging on your address," she said, "and found something rather interesting." She pressed up against me as she handed over the file, a bony shoulder and cloying perfume crowding into my personal space.'
p901
aS'Trying not to sneeze, I opened the file and pulled out the first page.'
p902
aS'Clutching the page, I scanned the smudged text. It was a blurry copy of an old newspaper ad, maybe from around the turn of the century. It advertised, in a hand-drawn, swirling font, some product called "DR. HENNESON\'S MAGICAL TINCTURES."'
p903
aS"I noticed the drawing of Dr. Henneson's storefront and almost choked on my tea."
p904
aS'The house in the picture was ours, no question about it: much newer and without the later extensions, but still.'
p905
aS'The ad was festooned with decorative ribbons with all-caps slogans swirling artfully around the house: RESTORATIVE ELIXIRS and WONDROUS CURE-ALLS and SUCH WONDERS AWAIT YOU. Tiny print along the bottom praised Dr.'
p906
aS'Henneson\'s unmatched skill at distilling his own secret medicinal ingredients from "the cleansing waters of an underground stream of utmost effervescent purity."'
p907
aS'The copy got less and less believable as it rambled on: "praised by the crowned heads of Europe" and "a cure to all diseases known by man and science" and "the true American fountain of youth" and so on.'
p908
aS'I flipped to the other few pages in the folder as the woman twittered on about her sleuthing skills in the county archives.'
p909
aS'The second page was a similar ad, but now the drawing of the house had been replaced with a sketch of a series of steaming tubs carved out of rock.'
p910
aS'ENJOY OUR HEALING GROTTOS, the ribbons said now, and BATHE IN THE WARMTH OF THE PURE WATERS OF LIFE, and finally, even bolder underneath that: EXPANDING ONCE AGAIN.\n\nExpanding.'
p911
aS'The final clipping was a short article giving notice that the house at our address, now billed more prosaically as "site of the discredited \'Doctor\' Henneson\'s smorgasbord of quackery,'
p912
aS'" had been condemned for "unsafe building practices" and was scheduled for immediate demolition.'
p913
aS'Apparently "in the wake of the building\'s abandonment" an appraiser had become concerned by "unauthorized constructions and extensions" and alerted city safety inspectors, who had deemed the building "unsound in the extreme."'
p914
aS'The final paragraph also alluded to a "disappearance" but failed to specify whose. Henneson\'s?'
p915
aS'That was the last clipping in the stack. There was no more about the disappearance and no explanation for why the unsound house had never been demolished after all and had survived, seventy years later, to be rented out to college students.'
p916
aS'I turned back to the first article and stared at it. The history lady noticed me staring and tapped it with a discolored fingernail. "Voodoo," she said.\n\n"Excuse me?"'
p917
aS'"Doesn\'t say here, but Henneson\'s a Negro name." She sniffed, disdainful. "This kind of thing was quite common back in those days. Lots of his type coming through after the Depression, selling snake oil, or worse. Black magic.'
p918
aS'Letting the Devil loose on good and decent folk. Preying on their sickness."\n\n"I\'m pretty sure there were a lot of white con artists, too," I said, trying to control my anger.'
p919
aS'"Been seeing ghosts in that house, have you?" she asked, ignoring me. "No wonder. Lord knows what terrible things he did to people, down in those grottos."'
p920
aS'"There\'s no ghosts. That\'s not it. And I\'m pretty sure it\'s not voodoo either." I didn\'t know how, but I\'d never been more sure of anything in my life. I got to my feet, face flushed.'
p921
aS'"So I think I\'m going to head out now because I don\'t think you have a goddamned clue what you\'re talking about."'
p922
aS'She puckered her mouth, glanced again at my pride bracelet. "Well. Should have realized you\'d be the _sensitive_ type."'
p923
aS"I couldn't take this any more. Her racist bullshit aside, the notion that what was happening to me was a cute ghost story for her to solve was so disconnected from the growing existential dread of the past few days I wanted to slap her."
p924
aS"I tried to remember she'd done me a favor, but in that moment I couldn't stand her."
p925
aS"She was everyone who thought my problems had simple explanations, everything wrong with a world that was broken and couldn't be bothered to care about fixing itself. For a moment, brief and burning, I hated her."
p926
aS"And that's when her face came unstuck."
p927
aS'This was back when movies were still celluloid, and at the dollar theater by our house the film would sometimes jump the gate, get misaligned.'
p928
aS'When that happened the image would smear, frames no longer projected neat one after the other but running liquid through the machine, all movement turned into vertical bands of distorted color;'
p929
aS'and the audio would go juddery, vague, and distant, recognizable but distorted.'
p930
aS'Clipped and monstrous.\n\nThis was like that but in three dimensions.'
p931
aS'The woman exploded. Her face twisted and smeared, exposing blood and bone.'
p932
aS'The back of her tongue flapped against her pulsing epiglottis, her eyes round spheres peeling back, turning inside out, her lips deformed and pulled like taffy into a twisting shape that reached from the ceiling to her knees.'
p933
aS'Her fingers had gone long as tree branches and skinny like pencils, twisting and jerking backward at frantic angles; the pattern of her dress had multiplied and filled the empty spaces in the air and was so thick now I choked on it.'
p934
aS'Everything moved, everything in her sounded, and the sound was a scream, like her lungs were jet engines, her voice box a bleating thing the size of a cow being flayed alive.'
p935
aS'I dropped the teacup and the files: I vaguely remember them tumbling toward the floor in slow motion, spilling and twisting around each other. I was screaming too. All I wanted was to get away.'
p936
aS"I stumbled back and my head cracked against a cabinet of china plates; I held up my hands to shield myself, as if such a pathetic act could matter against a thing so huge and horrible. It came toward me, moving fast. I couldn't stop it."
p937
aS'My sanity frayed.'
p938
aS'And then she snapped back into herself, and her voice returned to normal. Almost. It still juddered, like the floor beneath her vibrated a hundred times a second.'
p939
aS'And her skin was boiling and rippling, like something inside it was desperate to get out. Thousands of tiny somethings pushing and pounding with disproportionate strength against her wrinkled flesh.'
p940
aS'She reached toward me---and maybe this was all in my head, maybe she was trying to help, reacting in shock to my reaction,'
p941
aS'what must have seemed like some kind of seizure---but as she opened her mouth to speak, the rippling distortions made it into a grin.'
p942
aS'A huge, horrible, ravenous grin, malevolent. Gleeful.\n\nHer reaching fingers writhed, and her eyes were wide and round as saucers.'
p943
aS'I jerked to my feet and ran.'
p944
aS"For a while I didn't even know what direction I was running. I bolted straight through intersections and past oblivious pedestrians, not seeing them. I wasn't thinking about anything at all."
p945
aS"I didn't stop until a knife in my side brought me up short, bent me double, and I realized I'd been running a long time."
p946
aS'I collapsed on a patch of hot grass and threw up, retching and gasping. Gnats scribbled the air around me. Somewhere a dog barked.'
p947
aS'I stayed there five or ten minutes, breathing jagged, looking down, studying my hands on the grass and my puke,'
p948
aS'dealing with those three things, the hands and the grass and the puke, not wanting or able to look up or deal with anything else.'
p949
aS'Nothing happened. After a while that started to help.'
p950
aS'Eventually I climbed to my feet, got my bearings. I realized I knew where I was. I walked slowly back to our house.'
p951
aS'I never went back for my bike.'
p952
aS'* * *\n\nWhen I got home, Niko was gone. I let myself into his bedroom and curled up on his bed, because I needed to be surrounded by something familiar. The smell of him was an anchor to reality. Maybe the only one.'
p953
aS"I came in here sometimes when he was gone, usually only when he left the door unlocked. I didn't touch anything."
p954
aS'I just wanted to see the pieces of his life in isolation from his too-bright self, read the story they told about him with no silhouette from that burning corona.'
p955
aS"Once I'd seen a brochure from the campus LGBT center in his trash can, and wondered about that for a long time: why he'd taken it, why he'd thrown it away."
p956
aS'I must have drifted off, because moments later the afternoon light was dying and his hand was on my shoulder, shaking it. I jerked awake, guilty excuses on my lips. He was screaming at me.'
p957
aS'"What the _fuck_ are you doing in here?" His face twisted with a rage I\'d never seen there, sharp and ragged.'
p958
aS'"I didn\'t... I just..." I staggered to my feet, not knowing what to say.'
p959
aS'"Get the fuck out," he shouted, and then I saw something behind the rage: a fear, a wild, desperate fear. There were tears in his eyes.'
p960
aS'"Get out, out of my fucking room, I just want to be _alone_," he yelled, and as I backed up stammering he shoved me,'
p961
aS'so hard I slammed into the wall, cracking my head, and then he dropped down on his haunches and buried his face in his hands and started to sob.'
p962
aS"I would have left except I'd only heard him sob like that once before, and I couldn't stand the thought of letting him do it alone."
p963
aS'"What happened?" I finally asked, back still pressed to the wall, afraid to move in any direction, towards him or away.'
p964
aS'He ran his hands through his hair, staying crouched, staring at the floor. "Something\'s... following me," he said at last, quiet, miserable. "Shadows. Something\'s wrong with the shadows."'
p965
aS'He looked up and past me, haunted, like speaking to someone behind my shoulder. "There\'s too many of them. I can see them squirming out of the corner of my eye. Like they can\'t all fit in the shade they\'ve been given.'
p966
aS"They're following me, wherever I move, like regular shadows except these ones are alive and thinking about me and looking at me and _hungry_ for me,"
p967
aS'and every time I turn around there\'s more of them pressing into the same space, packed tight, squeezing in, wriggling, more of them each time, more and more and more and more and more..."'
p968
aS'I knelt down,\ngrabbed his shoulders and shook him, then did it again, hard. His head flopped back and he grabbed my wrist, a faint annoyance reaching his face. I was glad to see anything there at all.'
p969
aS'I let him focus on me before saying, "There\'s no shadows."\n\nHe stared at me.'
p970
aS'I shook my head, more sure of it now. "That\'s not it. It\'s not voodoo, or ghosts, or a thing out there, stalking us. It _is_ us. We\'re what\'s wrong here. We\'re the ones who don\'t belong."'
p971
aS'I swallowed, bile still souring the back of my throat. "We\'re slipping. Losing our grip on... something. This whole world, maybe. Or it\'s losing its grip on us."\n\nI had his full attention now.'
p972
aS'"And I don\'t know what happens when we let go, or it does," I finished. "But I don\'t think it\'s good."'
p973
aS'He stared at me, hopeless. "There\'s no way back."'
p974
aS'"No. Not yet." I took a breath. "Not until we find one."'
p975
aS"Chapter 7\n\nWe turned the wall of his bedroom into a map, taping up big sheets of artist's paper from an old class, shoving piles of books and unwashed dishes and dirty socks and two scuffed snowboards out of the way to clear space."
p976
aS'He transferred our notebook sketches to the wall and we tried to fill in the rest from memory.'
p977
aS"It was imperfect, because stairs down there ran up and down and the wall was flat, and also because the hallways twisted at weird angles and we didn't have surveying equipment to sort them out. But it was a start."
p978
aS"It was also painfully incomplete. There were dozens of doors we'd never tried, branches and halls we'd only glanced into."
p979
aS"Almost everything we had seen was from that single hall off the big room, the one we'd tried on a whim our first time down. Other than peering around the first couple corners, we hadn't explored the other four halls at all."
p980
aS'Niko swept a hand across all the empty space. "We\'re fucked."'
p981
aS'"Look," I countered, "we know the other versions of us found a key, somewhere. And we also know the two sides are staying almost exactly in sync. Close enough to spill coffee the same way."'
p982
aS'"Not close enough to leave each others\' fucking sticky notes alone."'
p983
aS'"Still," I pressed on, "that means the keys can\'t have been too well-hidden. We could have almost found one, walked right past it. Maybe the only difference was a momentary decision about which door to go through, what wall to glance at."'
p984
aS'"Doesn\'t matter." He stirred his coffee, morose, and sat it down to cool on his dresser, next to a half-empty older mug growing a skim of mold. "The keys are useless now, anyway."'
p985
aS'"If there\'s one set of keys, there might be more. Other keys, other doors. And besides, we have no idea what else might be down there. We need to keep looking."'
p986
aS"He ran a hand through his hair, a familiar gesture, but he looked changed. His eyes were getting sunken, from lack of sleep or some more worrisome deficiency. His face, so often laughing, hadn't smiled in days."
p987
aS'"Synchronicity," he said. "That\'s the problem."\n\n"How do you mean?"'
p988
aS'"I think we\'re getting out of sync with them. Day by day, decision by decision, we\'re losing our lockstep. And the farther out of sync we drift, the harder it gets to go back."\n\n"Speculation."'
p989
aS'"And the deeper," he pressed on, "the deeper we\'ll have to go to find another way through."'
p990
aS'"Nice. You\'re leaping all the way past conclusions now to the realm of utter bullshit." But I didn\'t have energy to argue with him. Clearly we couldn\'t solve anything from up here. We needed to go back down.'
p991
aS'We had to fill in the blank spaces on that map.'
p992
aS'Our first expedition departed the next morning. We had backpacks, trail mix and energy bars, lots of flashlights and batteries, twine, spray paint, a compass, graph paper, whistles, and rope.'
p993
aS"Despite everything, I think the prep got us fired up a bit. If answers were down there, we'd find them. We skipped class and I called in sick to work, and we both agreed if necessary we'd do the same tomorrow, and the next day."
p994
aS'Finding a way back was top priority.'
p995
aS"We chose one of the unexplored halls off the big room, and decided to explore as much of it as we could, until we'd mapped it all or got too tired to keep going. We picked the one at the far end of the room, opposite the stairs back up."
p996
aS'Right away we found something different.'
p997
aS"The first few twists and turns were the same as what we'd seen before: carpet, wall sconces, scuffed doors."
p998
aS'But after a short and confusing snarl of hallways and tiny rooms, the floorplan opened up into an area with a slightly different style of sconces, and longer, straighter hallways.\n\nExcept some of them went straight down.'
p999
aS'We stood at the lip of one of these pits and peered over the edge. It was like someone had taken a regular hallway and stood it on end.'
p1000
aS'The brown carpet went right over the lip and continued straight down, passing sideways doors, sideways wall sconces.'
p1001
aS'Maybe seventy or eighty feet down, it hit a carpeted bottom and leveled out again, branching in opposite horizontal directions.'
p1002
aS"The pit filled the exact center of a junction; we could step around the corners into hallways leading off in the three other directions from the one we'd arrived. It was a five-way intersection, all at right-angles."
p1003
aS'A couple dozen paces down one of those halls was another pit.\n\n"What is this," Niko sighed, "challenge mode?"'
p1004
aS"When you think of treacherous terrain a basement hallway isn't the first thing that comes to mind, but clutching the corner and peering vertiginously down, the pit looked as unscalable as the Matterhorn."
p1005
aS"There was nothing to get a grip on, except the doorways every twenty feet or so. Clearly we couldn't get down without climbing gear, nor come back up without it either.\n\nIf you fell... if you got stuck down there..."
p1006
aS'We stepped carefully around the pit (which was awkward and terrifying because it came right up to the ninety-degree edge of the wall) and kept exploring on the same level. But the pits were everywhere.'
p1007
aS'Each horizontal hall would dead end sooner or later, and the side rooms were all small and empty. Some of them had hallway pits, too, leading down from their exact center.'
p1008
aS"After an hour we'd mapped out everything we could get to without a climbing harness. Other than going back to the big room, there was no way forward except fourteen pits, each at least fifty feet deep."
p1009
aS'"Maybe difficult is good." Niko perked up. "This is the first thing we\'ve had to work for. Maybe it means there\'s something interesting down there."'
p1010
aS'"Or maybe one of those other hallways leads to a room filled floor to ceiling with keys. No point guessing."'
p1011
aS"We went back to explore one of the other halls---we didn't have much choice---and found something different there, too. About half the doors led not to rooms, but to crawlways."
p1012
aS'They were those half-sized doors you find sometimes that open onto water heaters or the electric meter in your house.'
p1013
aS'Flush with the floor and about three-and-a-half feet tall, they opened onto similarly miniaturized corridors, snaking off in two directions for a dozen feet with T-junctions at each end.'
p1014
aS'Niko leaned casually against the door and poked his head inside with a suave expression. "Hey," he said to the crawlway, "How _you_ doin\'?"\n\nWe figured out pretty quick it was a maze.'
p1015
aS'You could stoop-walk, but crawling on all fours was a lot more comfortable. (For me, at least. Niko kept bumping his head and swearing.) The tiny hallways branched and split constantly, keeping to neat ninety-degree angles.'
p1016
aS'Those ever-present wall sconces remained brightly lit, but the crawlway never went the same direction for long. Doors were scarce, and they all led back to normal-sized halls.'
p1017
aS'Once we realized how easy it would be to get lost, we retraced our steps and sat panting by the entrance.'
p1018
aS'"Promising," Niko said. "They\'re making us work for it."'
p1019
aS'"Makes no difference," I said. "It\'s the same problem again. We can\'t risk getting lost down here."'
p1020
aS'"But this is easier, man. We don\'t need specialized equipment. Just some way to leave a path. Hansel and Gretel, like you said."'
p1021
aS"Or maybe Ariadne. I had a ball of twine in my pack, so we settled for a simple solution: tying one end to my ankle, and the other around the half-door's knob."
p1022
aS'After some deliberation, we decided to keep our packs on, despite the awkwardness of crawling the tunnels with them. Having girded ourselves with stuff, we felt naked without it now.\n\nWe set off to map.'
p1023
aS"It wasn't long before we realized the crawlways accounted for an oddity in our mapmaking. If you look at the blueprint of a normal house, it's economical with space."
p1024
aS'Rooms and closets and halls fit into each other like well-stacked Tetris pieces. Downstairs was not like that. Large swaths of empty space surrounded most of the rooms. Hallways went farther than they needed to, adjacent to nothing.'
p1025
aS"Niko'd talked about bringing a sledgehammer down and breaking through one to see what was behind it---but now we had an idea. The maze of crawlways filled up the emptiness behind the walls. Not in any logical or sensible way, though."
p1026
aS'As we started mapping them out in a notebook, I remembered the graph paper mazes I used to draw in school. A crawlway would wrap around the outlines of what must have been a room, then double back and wrap around itself again.'
p1027
aS'Sometimes a bunch of branches would split off from a small area. There were dead ends.'
p1028
aS'We had no sense of whether we were on the edge of the thing, near the center, or if the geography even had a regular enough shape for those terms to signify.'
p1029
aS"We'd figured all this out before moving too far, comparing what we'd seen to our map."
p1030
aS'Niko developed a plan to push toward a direction where we thought there should be lots of empty space, and find out whether the crawlways filled that up too.\n\nWhat happened next caught us completely unprepared.'
p1031
aS"We'd started crawling in a promising direction. I'd begun to feel almost cheerful: we were solving the mystery, peeling back this place's secrets. Surely it was just a matter of time before we found a way back home."
p1032
aS'And then something _yanked_ my ankle from behind.'
p1033
aS'I gasped and twisted around. The twine tied to my ankle was taut, and pulling me with terrible force, starting to drag me back the crawlway. I cried out, digging my fingers into the carpet.'
p1034
aS'The twine scraping against the edge of the junction behind us sounded coarse and ugly, like a rusty knife dragged over the hairy skin of a coconut.'
p1035
aS'"What the fuck, _help me!_" I shouted. The loop around my ankle was viciously tight, cutting off circulation. My fingers scrabbled for purchase but the carpet wasn\'t shaggy enough to grip.'
p1036
aS'Niko scrambled back towards me, shrugging out of his pack and grabbing my arm. But as he pulled me back the twine dug into my ankle like a vise, like the pressure would saw the line straight through my foot. It _hurt_.'
p1037
aS'I couldn\'t understand why it hadn\'t snapped. "Cut it, fucking cut it!" I gasped.'
p1038
aS'He cursed and let me go, whipping back around to zipper open his pack, letting the line start to drag me away. The sound of the twine scraping the corner seemed way too loud, like someone was holding a mike against it.'
p1039
aS'I reached up to grab a wall sconce and the cheap thing twisted off in my hand, sparking as the bulb went out. I held onto it stupidly as the line around my ankle dragged us both away, reeling out drywall-dusted power cable from the wall.'
p1040
aS'I panicked. My mind flashed through visions of monsters waiting just around the corner, reeling me in. A horned demon. Some evil-eyed little girl from a shitty horror movie.'
p1041
aS'And then the history lady flashed into my head, inside-out and distorted past the breaking point, eyes white and wide;'
p1042
aS'and I jabbed my fingers into the grooves in the fake wooden wall paneling and started babbling\n\n SUCH WONDERS AWAIT YOU\n\nmind slipping towards the only place it might be safe\n\n EXPANDING ONCE AGAIN\n\nand Niko cut the twine.'
p1043
aS"I missed the lead-up in my nightmare, but he'd dug through his pack for the Swiss army knife, lost at the bottom with the camping gear, then struggled to squeeze ahead of me without kicking me in the face."
p1044
aS"He told me later he'd barely touched the blade to the twine when the taut line snapped, whipping around the corner in a fraction of a second."
p1045
aS'He had to spend a minute calming me down. Maybe it would be a better story if I left this out, but I was crying, bawling like a baby, and my pants were wet.'
p1046
aS'What brought me back, prosaically enough, was the growing unpleasant tingling in my foot. Pins and needles: painful, but familiar.'
p1047
aS'The knot on the twine had slipped down and pulled a tight loop around my leg just above the ankle, digging half an inch into my jeans. Niko helped me cut it off and I sat rubbing my foot for a long time, calming down, waiting.\n\nListening.'
p1048
aS'After maybe fifteen minutes we started back, Niko up front with the knife. I was equally terrified bringing up the rear, though, constantly looking over my shoulder, miserable and afraid.'
p1049
aS'The fact that the lighting was so bright and consistent, so cheery, only tinged my fear a more metallic shade.'
p1050
aS"Around the corner we found the cut end of the twine, slack and unmoving. We followed it all the way back to where we'd come in."
p1051
aS"It was no longer tied to the doorknob, like we'd left it. The twine lay coiled up in a neat loop. Right outside the threshold."
p1052
aS'Chapter 8\n\n"This changes everything," Niko was saying. We were in the weird little room behind the closet with the unfinished board game, dust gathering on unresolved plans for world domination.'
p1053
aS"We'd moved all our expedition gear in here; we didn't want to explain things to anyone else, and the rest of the housemates had forgotten this room even existed."
p1054
aS'I rubbed the ugly bruise ringing my ankle, sitting on the grimy hardwood floor with my pant leg rolled up.'
p1055
aS'"Does it? How?" I winced, prodding a tender spot.'
p1056
aS'"It\'s the first concrete sign there\'s something down there. Not glints of light. Not sounds. Something physical."\n\n"Yeah, reassuring."'
p1057
aS'He conceded the point, slumping down next to me. "But why now? What brought this on? Is the maze forbidden? Did we break some kind of rule?"\n\n"Marking our way."'
p1058
aS'"What?"'
p1059
aS'I sniffed."It\'s the first time we\'ve tried to leave a permanent trail, something unambiguously marking the way back. Maybe whatever it is... ugh." It still felt awful to verbalize it, give it that kind of legitimacy.'
p1060
aS'"Maybe it didn\'t care for that."'
p1061
aS'"Or maybe whatever\'s down there doesn\'t want us exploring the crawlways. Because they lead to something. Something big." He punched the wall, suddenly angry. "Who fucking knows? None of it makes any goddamn sense."'
p1062
aS'"That\'ll go on our tombstones. A week from now, when we\'re dead of dimension poisoning." He raised an eyebrow at me: _Really?_ I shrugged. "Either that or lung cancer from the smokes, bro. You pick."'
p1063
aS"He laughed despite himself, and I chalked up a mental win. Cheering him up, making him smile, was so ingrained in me I barely noticed I was doing it any more. Maybe that day, I shouldn't have been."
p1064
aS"It wasn't exactly a situation to be cheerful about."
p1065
aS'_Do I do it because I really want him to be happy? Or is it that I can\'t stand it when he\'s sad?_\n\n"I\'m not going down there again," he said with grim finality.'
p1066
aS'We both contemplated that for a long minute.'
p1067
aS'"Okay fine, I am. You\'re right. You win. We find a way back. Somehow."\n\n"There\'s monsters up here, too," I said softly.'
p1068
aS'He sniffed. "Or maybe we\'re the monsters, man. Crawled out from under the bed."'
p1069
aS"* * *\n\nWe decided to explore the vertical shafts, instead of going back into the crawlways. We didn't know whether what had happened was a message or a provocation. I thought the bruises on my ankle were message enough: Keep Out."
p1070
aS"Niko argued that was exactly why we should ignore it. Wherever they don't want you to go is probably the most interesting place to be. On the other hand, maybe the message had been like fences around Chernobyl."
p1071
aS'Maybe whatever was farther in was worse.'
p1072
aS"So we settled on the shafts, which were unusual and promising terrain without even mild signs of demonic infestation. One of Niko's ex-hobbies was rock climbing, but he'd stopped after the accident jacked up his wrists."
p1073
aS"Bits of gear still lingered around his overstuffed bedroom, though, so we'd assembled some rope, harnesses, carabiners, and a couple of grappling hooks we found at the sporting goods store."
p1074
aS'The box called them "Grip Monkeys," which seemed incongruously cheerful.'
p1075
aS'Niko took me up into the canyons to teach me some climbing and test the Grip Monkeys. It felt strange to leave the house, breathe hot air and smell external things, outside things, moss and leaves and rain.'
p1076
aS"Climbing didn't come naturally to me but Niko was patient and a good teacher, and knew his knots and technique. By the time we were loading our packs for the next expedition, I felt reasonably confident I wouldn't immediately kill us both."
p1077
aS"We picked the first pit, since they all seemed about the same, and set about securing the grapples in a doorjamb in a way that would hold our weight. We'd each go down on our own rope, one at a time and using the second as backup."
p1078
aS'We also had extra Grip Monkeys in our pack, in case something happened to these.'
p1079
aS'Along with the usual gear, we also brought down a camcorder. We were too broke to afford the newer all-digital cameras, so we borrowed one that shot on Hi-8 tape.'
p1080
aS"This was before the whole found footage craze, so we didn't think to take the camera down the pit with us and record weepy confessionals into it: we were going to leave it down the hall from the shaft,"
p1081
aS'trained on the pit and our ropes and the Grip Monkeys, hopefully capturing anything that tried to mess with us.'
p1082
aS"When we were ready, and since we didn't have a tripod, I left the camera on the floor a dozen paces back, pointed at the pit, and hit record. We shouldered our packs and Niko tied on to the rope."
p1083
aS'Moving carefully, he stepped over the lip, and started to rappel down the carpeted "floor" of the shaft. I watched his grapple nervously, but it held his weight, tines set deep into the solid wood of the door frame.'
p1084
aS'The bottom of the shaft seemed a mile down with Niko dangling above it, but probably only dropped about seventy feet. He moved fast and soon was stepping onto the once-again-horizontal carpet at the bottom.'
p1085
aS'He shined his light back up at me and gave the all-clear.'
p1086
aS"I followed him down, trying to think only in particulars about what was happening and not the terrifying big picture. I focused on what Niko had taught me, what my hands were doing. One thing at a time. Presently I'd made it down too."
p1087
aS'The hall at the bottom of the pit stretched off to either side, like we were at the junction of an upside-down T. Detaching from our dangling ropes, we picked a direction and began to explore.\n\nThings got weird down there.'
p1088
aS"The hallways continued on as they had above, and there were more pits. But now they didn't go straight down. Not quite. They descended at angles ranging from subtle to severe, never quite true to vertical. Some were almost ramps."
p1089
aS"Others changed their angle or gradually twisted as they dropped. And while the pit we'd rappelled down was lit, none of these were. They plunged down into darkness."
p1090
aS'And there were more of them. A lot more. Hundreds. Most opened from the middle of a hallway, filling its width: easy to jump across, but wearing a pack you felt clumsy, were acutely aware you were one stumble away from a very bad time.'
p1091
aS'We decided to avoid unnecessary leaps, but the pits were so thick they hedged us in, pushed us inexorably towards an unknown destination.'
p1092
aS"If we tried to veer too far off course, they'd get denser, and we'd have to backtrack or turn aside, angling back to our former heading. And the farther we went that way, the more the hallway angles edged off true."
p1093
aS"It was subtle at first. But the horizontal hallways became less and less level. We'd stumble on a floor that canted slightly left, or tilted half a degree up or down."
p1094
aS'The walls, too, were growing angled, some leaning outward a degree or two instead of staying neatly parallel, or bent a little bit inward at mismatched angles. It made us feel drunk.'
p1095
aS"You've seen so many well-constructed hallways in your life, your brain doesn't know how to process ones that don't behave.\n\nWe kept going."
p1096
aS'The halls branched and spread endlessly. We gave up trying to map, other than the route back. We passed through regions of darkness and regions of light. The decor rarely varied from its ubiquitous blandness.'
p1097
aS'Sometimes little things were wrong. A door, off its hinges, lying neat and flat in the center of the hall. A light fixture sticking out of the carpet. Crown molding running in a line a foot above the carpet.'
p1098
aS'We searched around these anomalies, but never found anything useful.'
p1099
aS'Some of the rooms got larger, too big for rooms in a house. More like a school gymnasium. Still the same carpet, though. And it felt like we were seeing more of the anomalies, the farther in and deeper down we got.'
p1100
aS'Doors or sections of hallway paved in bathroom tile; weird cube-shaped extrusions or cavities in the edges of rooms. It was like the deeper we went, the more flexible the rules became---of architecture, of stability, of god knows what else.'
p1101
aS'Behind one unassuming door we found something that looked almost like a backstage, with a wood floor painted black instead of a carpet, cinderblock walls with folding chairs stacked against them by the hundreds.'
p1102
aS'But no curtain, no audience, no racks of lights above. In fact there was nothing above: the walls rose up beyond the range of our flashlights.'
p1103
aS'In the exact center of the room was one of those caged metal utility ladders, climbing up into that darkness.'
p1104
aS'Mostly because it was going up and not down, we decided to try it. Or I decided, anyway, hands gripping the cool metal rungs before Niko could raise an objection. I felt reckless down here, brave enough to try anything.'
p1105
aS'The exact opposite of the me on the surface.'
p1106
aS"Besides, the ladder looked just like the one at my junior high when I'd been on stage crew. I'd climbed it a million times. The metalwork of the cage felt like a blanket. Safe."
p1107
aS"Within a minute I'd climbed disturbingly high. I didn't look down but the beam of Niko's flashlight, trained on me, had faded to glimmers, washed out by my own. Everything around and above was dark. And _quiet_."
p1108
aS'All Downstairs was quiet, of course, but here it seemed monstrously so, a quiet of infinitudes, even the sounds of my own body sucked away into the emptiness around me.\n\nNiko seemed so far away.'
p1109
aS'"Find anything up there?" he asked, putting a hand on my shoulder. Startled, I looked down. My hands were still gripping the rungs of the ladder, but my foot was on the floor of the stage. I was on the ground. Niko was beside me.'
p1110
aS'"What happened?" I felt dizzy.'
p1111
aS'He frowned. "You climbed up for a while, then you came back down. Anything up there?"'
p1112
aS"I made him try. The same thing happened. I watched him climb up, high into the darkness above. Then, without missing a beat, he reversed course and came back down. When he made it back to me he was as startled as I'd been."
p1113
aS"He felt like he'd been climbing up the whole time."
p1114
aS"We tried experiments. Keeping in verbal contact. Focusing on our movements. With enough of that, it was possible to realize that you'd started moving down again before you'd come all the way back."
p1115
aS'But always with a sick and juddering sense of grinding gears: one part of your brain kicking in and telling another it had been looking at things wrong. It took a moment to perceive, like an optical illusion.'
p1116
aS"We stopped after a particularly nauseating moment when I was listening to Niko below me chanting _You're coming down, you're coming down, you're coming down_, and all my senses were telling me that was wrong, that I was still climbing up,"
p1117
aS'climbing up, climbing up, and when the truth crashed into my perception I felt such a wave of sickness that I almost lost my grip on the ladder, had to clutch it shivering for minutes, cold sweat breaking out all over my body.'
p1118
aS'After that we decided to stop experimenting.'
p1119
aS'We were getting tired. Just before turning back, though, we found one last curious room. We could hear it before we opened the door.'
p1120
aS'The room was the size of a squash court, though not quite as tall, the whole thing covered in green bathroom tile, even the inside of the door we came through. A sink rose serenely from its center.'
p1121
aS'Scalding water blasted from the faucet, releasing clouds of billowing steam and filling the air with a moist, sticky warmth.'
p1122
aS'The sink was full, water spilling over its sides and flowing down the porcelain like some artsy fountain, then streaming away across the tile, presumably according to some imperceptible tilt in the floor.'
p1123
aS'It vanished down an open hallway, carpeted once again, slanting down at a steep angle from a corner of the room.'
p1124
aS'We walked over to the hallway to peer down. It was closer to vertical than horizontal, dropping at a vicious angle.'
p1125
aS'Where the hot stream hit the tilted carpet it became black with mold, and the walls and ceiling were stained with rust and moss. Like water had been coursing through it for a long, long time.'
p1126
aS'From the slanting darkness rose a hot smell of rot.\n\n"This feels different," Niko said.'
p1127
aS'We walked back to the sink and tried to turn off the faucet, but the hot and cold knobs spun loose. The scalding water rushed full force out of the tap, churning noisily in the basin.'
p1128
aS'"Gonna have a hell of a water bill," I joked, but then remembered something. The newspaper article from the history lady, about Dr. Henneson\'s wondrous elixirs. It said he\'d bottled them in an underground grotto.'
p1129
aS'A natural spring welling up from deep beneath the earth.'
p1130
aS"Something felt on the verge of snapping into place, making sense. But I couldn't quite see it."
p1131
aS'Tentative, I cupped my hands in the scalding hot water and brought a sip to my mouth. It had the familiar flat and faintly chemical taste of tap water. It did not seem effervescent. I did not feel healed.'
p1132
aS'Niko was beaming his flashlight down the tunnel, chasing the descending path of the stream. "This would be rough going. Steep and slick. We\'d need better climbing gear. And I can\'t see how far down it goes."'
p1133
aS'I took a deep breath. "It feels like that\'s the way, though. Doesn\'t it?"'
p1134
aS'He ran a hand through steam-wilted hair, eyes still pulled down the shaft. "Jesus, I hope not."'
p1135
aS"* * *\n\nI couldn't stop thinking about the wet tunnel as we retracted our steps. Images of it flashed through my mind. The desire to know what was past the reach of our flashlight beams, what was down there, was maddening."
p1136
aS"I was planning how soon we could come back down, what we'd have to bring with us. What it would take to keep pushing deeper."
p1137
aS"We passed through the last few hallways to the base of shaft we'd come down. On the carpet directly underneath were our ropes, coiled up neat, Grip Monkeys still tied to the end."
p1138
aS'"God damn it," Niko said with feeling, craning his head to glare accusingly at the shaft and fling curses up its length. We couldn\'t see anything unusual up there, not from down here.\n\nOur way back up had been cut off.'
p1139
aS"We had extra grapples in our packs, but the originals didn't seem damaged: just detached. The shaft was too narrow to throw one all the way back up without hitting a wall, so we settled for hooking a doorway, halfway up."
p1140
aS"Our position now was much more precarious. We couldn't tell if the grapple was set properly: we just had to trust it. Niko volunteered to go first. From the ground below, I watched him climb, anxious."
p1141
aS"But I felt too bone-tired to worry much about anything by then. Niko was a good climber. We'd made it down without incident. I was confident we'd make it back up."
p1142
aS'So I was caught completely by surprise when the grappling hook ripped through the molding of the wooden doorframe far above, and Niko fell.'
p1143
aS'Chapter 9\n\nTime seemed to snap and twist back on itself in opposing directions, both too fast and too slow.'
p1144
aS"Terror struck me like lightning, searing me with unbearable matching thoughts: _he's going to die_ and _there's nothing I can do to help him_."
p1145
aS'Then he grabbed the edge of the next doorframe down and his body slammed against the horizontal door beneath. I watched the bottoms of his sneakers as they kicked and flailed at the smooth beige wall, scrabbling for purchase.'
p1146
aS'He was still too far up. _Too far._ If he fell...'
p1147
aS'"Are you okay?" I shouted up at him, or something equally useless. My lungs were clenched so tight that for a minute I couldn\'t breathe back in.'
p1148
aS"He'd managed to press the toes of his sneakers up against the wall, but there was nothing to stand on. His position was desperate, hands gripping the inch of molding like claws. I could see muscles trembling even from here."
p1149
aS'He clung to the wall quivering like a caught-out insect, paralyzed with indecision.'
p1150
aS'"You\'re okay." I tried to keep my voice light, in control, willing confidence into it and up to him. My mind thrummed as it raced to find him a way out.'
p1151
aS'He was still clipped on to the climbing rope but the grapple now swayed useless beneath him.'
p1152
aS'The hallway pit ran featureless above and below the doorframe he clung to: there was nothing else to get a grip on, not for a dozen feet in either direction.'
p1153
aS'"The door." I projected calm authority. "You need to get the door open. If there\'s a room inside, it\'ll only be a little drop. Niko. Are you listening to me?"'
p1154
aS'He shook his head, as if snapping out of shock, found the doorknob beneath him and focused on it. It was on the bottom side of the door from our perspective, at waist-height for Niko, but too far off to the side to easily reach.'
p1155
aS'He lifted an ineffectual foot to try kicking at it, but it was too high. I watched his fingers slip towards the edge of the molding.'
p1156
aS'"Nice idea." I tried to keep my voice steady. "Just try again, okay? I\'m right here. If you fall, I\'ve got you." But did I, really? My arms were stretched out stupidly, but if he fell into them from that height it would break us both.'
p1157
aS"He kicked again, more desperate this time, foot still far from the knob. His shoe scudded across the smooth paint of the door. His fingers gripped the molding so tight they'd gone white. He couldn't hold a grip like that much longer."
p1158
aS'"You almost had it," I lied. "Come on, buddy, you got this."'
p1159
aS'"Just shut up for a second," he shouted, flashing a glare down at me. "Stop fucking telling me what you think I want to hear and shut up."'
p1160
aS"I fell silent, face flushed, paralyzed. Singed.\n\nHe stared at the knob, and the silence sharpened until I couldn't help but break it, to say out lout what I knew he was thinking."
p1161
aS'"You\'ll have to let go with one hand." I said it as even as I could. "Just for a second. To turn the knob." I breathed. "There\'s no other way."'
p1162
aS'He nodded. I stood helpless below him, arms still stretched up, aching.\n\nThen he did it.'
p1163
aS'In one quick move he pressed his body in toward the door, letting his toes take as much weight as they could, let go of the frame with his left hand and thrust it out hard toward the knob.'
p1164
aS"He brushed it and for a horrible moment it looked like he wouldn't be able to grip it and turn it, the angle all wrong, and so was his balance, now; but then his fingers wrapped around the knob, his wrist twisted and it turned."
p1165
aS'The door clunked and swung inwards from the bottom as his weight pushed against it, and he half-collapsed, half-scrambled through as his balance was lost, fingers slipping off the frame.'
p1166
aS'He tumbled inside, banging knees and shins, and fell through, the door swinging shut behind him like a cat flap, muffled thumps and curses making their way through the walls.'
p1167
aS'But before I could even breathe out, a shock of awful, sawtoothed sound smacked into me from above, and I was so startled I bit my tongue.'
p1168
aS'It was utterly alien, a juddering metallic _twang_ that lingered in the air, throbbing, jittery, reluctant to die away.\n\nAnd then I realized what it was.'
p1169
aS'The sound turned in an instant from monstrous to mundane. Niko must have thwacked it as he tumbled past, flailing: one of those springy metal doorstoppers, no doubt surprised to meet a falling body instead of a hastily opened door.'
p1170
aS'* * *\n\nWe made it to the top, in the end.'
p1171
aS'It took a series of shorter climbs to each sideways room, treating them like miniature base camps, places to rest before flinging the grapple up another dozen feet to the next door, the next cube of safety;'
p1172
aS'testing each set of the grapple more thoroughly, belaying each other as best we could in the patently unsafe circumstances.'
p1173
aS"But at length, we'd made it back out."
p1174
aS'"Sorry about earlier. What I said." I\'d just grabbed his hand pulling me up the last few feet, and now we were sprawled on the carpet, mercifully horizontal again, like two mountaineers on the world\'s blandest summit.'
p1175
aS'"Don\'t worry about it. You just... do that sometimes, and it bugs me." _Tell him what I think he wants to hear._ I shut my eyes. "I wish you\'d..." He lifted a hand, gestured vaguely in the air, dropped it in defeat. "Whatever, forget it.'
p1176
aS'There\'s a million more important things to worry about."\n\nThe camcorder was where we\'d left it, sitting on the carpet pointed at the pit.'
p1177
aS"The door frame where our original grapples had been attached wasn't damaged. We'd seated them pretty firmly, so this suggested that rather than being yanked free from below, someone had carefully unhooked them from up here."
p1178
aS'Of course, the ropes had also been neatly coiled at the bottom. Someone had to have done that from down there.'
p1179
aS"I didn't want to watch the tape, not while we were still Downstairs. But Niko, face grim, insisted. So I huddled miserably beside him while we watched the footage on the tiny flip-out screen."
p1180
aS'The tape had run to the end, so we backed it up a bit and hit play. To our dismay, the ropes were going over the edge right to the end; whatever happened, it had been after the tape ran out.'
p1181
aS'Niko held down the rewind button and we settled in for a long haul. We spooled back through the whole tape, but nothing changed: it was two hours of motionless footage of the hallway and our ropes.'
p1182
aS'Finally we saw ourselves spring back up from the pit at high speed, first me and then him; dicker with the grapples and rope, then zip over to the camera to turn it on. The tape clunked to a stop.'
p1183
aS'Cursing up a blue streak, Niko hit play.'
p1184
aS"We watched in numb frustration as everything we'd done earlier played back: the same discussions about rope and seating the grapples, the same lame jokes failing to ease tension. There wasn't much point to watching it all unfold again."
p1185
aS"We just didn't know what else to do."
p1186
aS'On the tiny screen, I was standing a pace or two back, wondering aloud how much gear we should take down with us. I hated how my voice sounded on tape, how my face looked. I always had. Even on the tiny screen I could see red blotches.'
p1187
aS'On the screen a miniature Niko sat on the edge of the pit, adjusting his ropes.\n\nDistorted by the shitty camcorder speaker, he said, "How far down do you think this goes?"'
p1188
aS'My image shrugged, said "We should possibly go much deeper."'
p1189
aS'My skin crawled. "Oh my god."'
p1190
aS'Niko glanced at me. "What?"'
p1191
aS'"That\'s not what I said." My head was spinning. What _had_ I said? Something like _It can\'t possibly go much deeper_, maybe. Not that.'
p1192
aS'Screen-Niko said "You\'re right. Actually, we shouldn\'t the two of us come back this way at all. No. We should go down and we should let\'s stay down, down and deep." His voice sounded strained, but he pulled his rope tight smartly.'
p1193
aS'"Don\'t come back until we find it, friend. What it is we ought to find."'
p1194
aS'Where it gripped the camcorder, Niko\'s hand was pale. "I didn\'t say that either," he breathed. "I mean I said something about that long, some of those words and phrases maybe.'
p1195
aS'But they\'re _different they\'re fucking different---_"\n\nI shushed him, because the voices on the tape were speaking again. But now the words were familiar, mundane.'
p1196
aS'We both watched the screen, afraid to blink, but nothing else seemed changed. Everything played out as we remembered. Except now every word and gesture caused a spike of uncertainty. _Had_ I said that, exactly that?'
p1197
aS'Had I moved my arm that way, stood in precisely that spot?'
p1198
aS"Video Niko started to rappel. The camera focused on my legs as I stood up top, watching him descend. On the screen I waited, then clipped onto the rope once he'd made it to the bottom."
p1199
aS'Video Ryan checked his harness, took a deep breath, and started down.'
p1200
aS'He paused before his head dropped out of frame to call down to Niko: "Coming down." I remembered saying that, I thought.\n\nThen he turned and looked straight at the camera.'
p1201
aS'Straight into the lens.\n\nHe held the gaze for a long moment.'
p1202
aS'Then glanced, deliberate, down the shaft. Then back to the camera.\n\nWide-eyed.'
p1203
aS'His head dropped out of sight.\n\nWe sat frozen, watching the video of the empty hall for a minute, two, the grainy image showing nothing but the empty hall and our ropes.'
p1204
aS'Niko breathed out. "Jesus." He closed the screen and sat the camera down, backing away from it like it was a bomb. "Jesus fucking Christ."'
p1205
aS'I kept staring at it. EXPANDING ONCE AGAIN floated through my head, the copy from the old newspaper ad.\n\nSUCH WONDERS AWAIT YOU.'
p1206
aS'"Jesus," he kept muttering. "Jesus."'
p1207
aS'* * *\n\nWe slept in the big room that night because we always had low-level headaches now when we went upstairs.'
p1208
aS'We were becoming trolls, hiding from sounds, afraid to go out under the sky, only venturing from our cave to get more supplies, stock up for further ventures down. I slept under the foosball table, gathering dust.'
p1209
aS"No one but us had been down here for weeks.\n\nYou won't be surprised to hear I had nightmares."
p1210
aS"I replayed the tape in my dreams, over and over. Each time I rewound all the way to the start, intent to watch it through, make sure there wasn't some clue I'd missed. And each time the tape was different."
p1211
aS'It was always Niko and the pit and I, but never the same. And whenever something changed, fresh dread flooded through me.'
p1212
aS'Sometimes the changes were slight, hardly there, and I struggled to catch the altered words, the different glances.'
p1213
aS'Sometimes our words were rearranged, as if to make cryptic cyphers, buried meanings on the verge of making sense but never quite resolving.'
p1214
aS'In some of these variations, Niko and I were boyfriends. A couple. I could tell from the words we used, the way we looked at each other. Nothing that would have been obvious to anyone but me.'
p1215
aS'I watched these scenes over and over, rewinding to catch the little glances, secret smiles.\n\nThere were other, worse versions.'
p1216
aS'There were dream-tapes where a gaunt Ryan and Niko fought each other for control of the camera, staring manic into the lens with frantic mouths full of rotting teeth,'
p1217
aS"skin flaking beneath torn and faded rags sticky with dried blood, like they'd been trapped down there for months."
p1218
aS'They clawed at the lens, as if trying to climb into it. As if it somehow were a way back out.'
p1219
aS'There were tapes where we screamed at our watcher-selves to go away, to never come back again, that what was down there would destroy us. There were others, far worse, where we smiled like sharks, invited ourselves to come down, and stay.'
p1220
aS"There were versions with two Nikos or two Ryans, pretending to be two different people. There were versions where we _were_ different people, people I'd never seen."
p1221
aS'There were versions where we spoke other languages, or babbled idiot sounds and pretended they were speech.'
p1222
aS'There were versions where the carpet turned soft and we sunk into it like quicksand, Niko screaming while I smiled until fibers closed over my head. There were versions where hurricane winds sucked us screaming into the pit.'
p1223
aS'And on one tape---and I rewound and re-watched this over and over, in the dream---water from all the hallways poured into the pit, a four-sided waterfall.'
p1224
aS'The carpets were black and sticky with moss trailing down into the vertical shaft, the air thick with steam.'
p1225
aS'Something jostled the camera and it surged forward with the tide, water sloshing against the lens, until the scalding stream carried it over the edge and it fell,'
p1226
aS'straight down into that boiling pit, surrounded by water on every side, gathering speed, falling into wet and steaming dark, faster and faster and faster...'
p1227
aS"I would jerk awake at this point, coated in sweat, and try not to fall back asleep. But when I did I'd find myself rewinding the tape yet again and pressing play, hoping this time the footage would return to normal."
p1228
aS"It was always changed, and I'd have to watch it all over from the beginning, hoping this version would show something useful, a hint, a clue, an answer."
p1229
aS'* * *\n\nI woke to stale nicotine. Niko leaned against the stairs back up to my room, staring into the dark, a lit cigarette between his fingers.\n\n"Our lease says no smoking in here," I grunted, still shaking off nightmares.'
p1230
aS'He took another drag. "Blow me."'
p1231
aS'I laughed and he flashed me a wicked grin. It felt good to laugh. Even if it was a little bit forced, to make sure he knew that I knew he was kidding.'
p1232
aS'Rubbing my eyes, I sat up in my sleeping bag. After a moment I scrunched over beside him, back against the stairs.\n\nWe steeped in smoke and silence for a long minute.'
p1233
aS'"Did I ever tell you," he finally said, "about that time I went camping by myself, up in Brushwillow?" I shook my head. "Used to do that a lot, after the, uh. Accident."'
p1234
aS"I took that in. He hadn't brought it up in a long time. Neither had I."
p1235
aS'"I went by myself, cause I didn\'t want a lot of people around just then, and it\'s easier than twisting people\'s arms to get them to come with you. Planning around schedules, all that bullshit." He shifted into citation voice.'
p1236
aS'"\'The man who goes with another must wait until they\'re ready. The man who goes alone can leave today.\'"\n\n"Yeah, Thoreau. You quote that one a lot."'
p1237
aS'He shrugged. "I like it up there. Anyway."\n\nI waited, staring into the whorled beige universe of the carpet.'
p1238
aS'"So this one night I\'m up there, alone. I\'m in my tent, and it\'s dark. Cloudy, no moon. I\'m sleeping fine, on my back, you know, head up against the edge of the tent. And then I wake up, cause I hear something, just outside."'
p1239
aS'He sucked on the cigarette. "Something breathing. Low, hissing, gurgling breathing. Sounded huge, like a bear or something, a big-ass wolf. And it was right on the other side of the tent flap. Inches from my face.'
p1240
aS'Like something had pressed its muzzle against the nylon, that thin nothing sheet of ultralight fabric, and was waiting. It could smell my breath, maybe. Waiting for me to move. And as soon as I did, it would get me.'
p1241
aS'"I still remember what that felt like. Fucking terrifying.'
p1242
aS'"I was too scared to move, so I lay there a long time, hoping it would go away. But it didn\'t. The thing stayed where it was. Kept making those horrible breathing sounds. Inhale. Exhale. Raspy, choking."'
p1243
aS"He dropped the cigarette into an empty soup can we'd brought down as an ashtray."
p1244
aS'"And then I realized where the sound was coming from. The breathing was coming from me. I was sleeping on a root or something, my head had gotten into some funny angle. I was snoring, basically, and woke myself up.'
p1245
aS'But I didn\'t realize what woke me was a sound I was making myself."'
p1246
aS'I was too tired to process this. "Cool story."\n\n"Do you get what I mean, though?"'
p1247
aS'I rubbed a hand over my face, tried to think.'
p1248
aS'"You\'re saying maybe there\'s not... a _thing_ down there. That somehow, all of it is us."'
p1249
aS'"Echoes," he said. "Reflections. The rooms are reflections of our shitty old house, and the things we\'re seeing, experiencing down there, maybe they\'re not alive. We\'re causing them, somehow.'
p1250
aS'And now we\'re ascribing intentionality to side effects. Jumping at our own shadows." He lay back down on his sleeping bag, staring up at the ceiling.'
p1251
aS'I remembered something from a neurobiology class. "Did you know there are more neurons going from your brain to your eyes than in the other direction?"\n\n"So?"'
p1252
aS'"From your brain to your eyes," I repeated, "not the other way around."'
p1253
aS'He blinked. "That doesn\'t make sense."'
p1254
aS'"It does if you realize that vision is mostly the brain telling the eyes what it expects them to see." I rubbed my face again, trying to wipe off the exhaustion. "We think we have two little cameras in our head. We don\'t.'
p1255
aS'They\'re little yes-men, reassuring us nothing unexpected is happening. That\'s why that trick works, with the guy in the gorilla suit. You ever see that video in school?"'
p1256
aS'He nodded. "You\'re watching a bunch of people toss a ball around, and the guy in the gorilla suit walks right through them, and it\'s like he\'s invisible. He even waves. But you don\'t see him the first time, because you\'re watching the ball.'
p1257
aS'Then you watch it again looking for him and your mind\'s blown." He smiled faintly. "Dude in my high school science class swore the teacher changed the tape."'
p1258
aS'"You don\'t see the gorilla because you don\'t expect to. There\'s no reason he\'d be there, so your eyes don\'t notice him. Even though he\'s in plain sight. Standing right in front of you."\n\nWe were both quiet for a while.'
p1259
aS'"So maybe we\'re somehow looking at this wrong," I finally said. "We\'re not seeing something. We keep saying it doesn\'t make any sense. Maybe we\'re just not seeing it the right way."'
p1260
aS'"Maybe." He closed his eyes. "Or maybe there\'s nothing there to see."'
p1261
aS'I closed my eyes too, and tried to sleep. But\nI could feel the camcorder dream lingering, eager to take over again. I tried to fight it off, but I was so tired.'
p1262
aS'"Even if we are the wolf," Niko muttered, just as I was about to drift off, "that doesn\'t mean it\'s not trying to kill us."'
p1263
aS"* * *\n\nI tried to take a midterm and it was a disaster. I hadn't been to class in weeks, which didn't help, but everything I'd learned earlier had vanished from my brain, neurons reclaimed, I supposed, for more important things."
p1264
aS'Then I started hallucinating, questions and pencil marks multiplying and layering on themselves even when I looked up from the test,'
p1265
aS'abstractions filling the darkened auditorium, and I had to flee, whispering a hurried apology to the T.A. that I was having a medical emergency.'
p1266
aS"She told me to go home and take care of myself. I was halfway home before I remembered that phrase has a positive meaning, too.\n\nI'd thought she was telling me to commit suicide."
p1267
aS'Something was in my room when I got back. I stood outside the closed door, dried blood on my face, listening. It sounded like an elephant. Heavy, clopping footfalls made the floorboards groan. Wet, agitated breathing rasped.'
p1268
aS'Dust motes danced at my feet in a strange breeze, sucked under and pushed back out through the space below the closed door, rhythmic. Air moved with faint fleshy sounds, like a hundred quiet people flapping their arms, flailing.'
p1269
aS'I crept away, miserable, and by the time I came back with Niko and he threw open the door in some play at courage, there was nothing there.'
p1270
aS"I collapsed into his arms, sobbing, and he let me stay there for a while until I'd calmed down. I clung to him, afraid if I loosened my grip he'd disappear."
p1271
aS'He had a perpetual headache now. He kept describing it with the word "throbbing" and only that word, as if clinging to the sound of it.'
p1272
aS"Like using a different one would acknowledge the pain too had changed, grown worse, was no longer caged by the word he'd picked to trap it. I could see how much it hurt him to think, to make words, to move around. He ground his teeth."
p1273
aS'He was being worn down.'
p1274
aS"My headaches weren't getting worse, not yet anyway. It was the strain of always having them that wore on me. Of wondering if we'd have them for the rest of our lives."
p1275
aS'* * *\n\nWe left to explore down the slippery tunnel late that night.'
p1276
aS"It might have made more sense to go down after a good night's rest, but neither of us could sleep, and spending so much time down there meant night and day were becoming academic concepts anyway."
p1277
aS'Niko caffeined up (I was jittery enough already), and we loaded our packs with canned food and power bars, thick gloves, and crampons from the sporting goods store. "12 points of contact ensures solid grip on ice," the box had said.'
p1278
aS"We didn't expect the manufacturer had tested them on slime-covered carpet, but it was the best we could do."
p1279
aS"In my pack was also a gun. It had been my dad's."
p1280
aS"I hadn't wanted it but I couldn't throw it away, nor could I make myself go to the safety courses mom had signed me up for, or take it out from its box at the bottom of my closet with other things I didn't want to look at."
p1281
aS"But I hadn't forgotten I had it. I didn't tell Niko about the gun. I thought it would make me feel safer but it just felt heavy."
p1282
aS'It had been a hot day and the old house clung to that heat through the night with grim brick desperation. Descending into chillier air was a relief. With every step down the headaches diminished, our mood improved.'
p1283
aS'It was almost addictive, being down there.'
p1284
aS"We retraced our route through the upper halls to the top of the shaft and reset the grapples. This time Niko hammered them into the doorjamb, face set, until he'd driven the steel spikes three inches into the wood."
p1285
aS"Even so, neither of us really expected they'd still be there when we got back.\n\nWhen, or if."
p1286
aS'Getting down was a familiar exercise now, danger mitigated by procedure and repetition. We retraced our route to the tiled room with the sink.'
p1287
aS'The water was still running, hot and steaming, rushing across the floor to the corner with its angled hallway lined with slimy black carpet.'
p1288
aS"We shined our lights down the hot throat and the steam grabbed their brightness, bounced it back to us maliciously. We couldn't see more than a few body lengths down."
p1289
aS'Niko ran a hand through his curls, deflating again in the hot moist air; scratched the hair behind his ear furiously, like a dog with an itch. "Are we sure about this? Really really?'
p1290
aS'Because it sort of seems like a colossally stupid thing to do."\n\n"You have a better idea?"'
p1291
aS'"No. Is that what lemmings say to each other, you think? Before jumping?"'
p1292
aS'"The lemming thing is a myth." I shrugged out of my pack and unzippered it, digging for gear. "Walt Disney made it up because a bunch of wiggling rats made for boring footage. Good story, though, isn\'t it?"'
p1293
aS'He sighed, looking down the steaming shaft unhappily.\n\n"No, I don\'t have a better idea," he said at last.'
p1294
aS'We pulled on the crampons and the heavy gloves. Harness, rope, knots. Check. Niko pounded two new Grip Monkeys into either side of the angled tunnel entrance. We tied on. Double-check.'
p1295
aS'Then, each holding our rope, kicking hard to sink the sharp toes of the crampons deep into the slimy carpet, we started down.'
p1296
aS'It was slow, hot work. Once we got inside the slanted hall, the steam was oppressive, everywhere: we were instantly drenched with it, like rot-smelling sweat. Even with the crampons our feet slipped.'
p1297
aS'The sludge was deep and slick, a stew of algae and mold and fungal slimes, green-black and stinking of putrefying jungle, of horrible things happening under your carpet, inside your walls. We held tight to the ropes with steam-wet gloves.'
p1298
aS'The walls and floor twisted and bent as we descended, as if the constant moisture had warped them, but the downward angle stayed relentless.'
p1299
aS"It was a gullet. We were letting ourselves be swallowed. No---worse. We were forcing ourselves in. Eager. Like we couldn't wait to be digested.\n\nWe were nearing the end of our sixty meter ropes when everything went to shit."
p1300
aS'All at once we were sliding. Our ropes had gone slack in our hands, no longer connected to anything. There was no time to dig in the crampons; we were already moving too fast, careening down like a grotesque slalom.'
p1301
aS'Neither of us screamed, focused I guess on trying to grab hold of something, anything, but there were no doorways, no light fixtures, nothing but the thick hot slime and the scalding water.'
p1302
aS"I tried to dig my feet into the oozing carpet but my loose rope had entangled me, my pack was in my way, my face was smeared with scalding gunk and I couldn't open my eyes."
p1303
aS"My hand closed on Niko's leg and I grabbed it. A moment later the floor angle shifted and he cried out, threw his body sideways, brought us both to a shuddering, squelchy stop."
p1304
aS"We were soaked through, overheating. Scalding water ran past us down the slope. I blinked my eyes open and saw he'd wedged himself into a kink in the tunnel."
p1305
aS"One of his knees was scraped open and a dull red mark on his forehead was beginning to swell. But he'd done it. He'd stopped us."
p1306
aS'Ropes slithered down the tunnel past us, followed moments later by two grapples still tied to their ends.'
p1307
aS"Niko reached out to grab one with his free hand, but his weight shifted, and he had to throw the hand back against a wall to re-brace, cursing. I tried to snag them with my foot, but didn't even come close."
p1308
aS'They vanished down the tunnel, trailing rope.'
p1309
aS'Niko\'s face was tight. He tilted his head down toward me. "This was a mistake. God, we\'re so fucking stupid. Ryan, man. We have to go back."'
p1310
aS'"Calm down," I gasped, head filled with the roaring of the water, blinking gunk from my eyes. "Don\'t panic. We can do this."'
p1311
aS'"Man, I\'m barely holding on. I don\'t know how much longer I can keep from slipping. We have to try to climb back up."'
p1312
aS'"Back?" I said, confused. "You want to go back?"'
p1313
aS'He stared down at me. "Of course back. Are you fucking crazy? Where the fuck else?"'
p1314
aS'"There\'s nothing good up there. Nothing right." I kicked my foot for purchase, managed to rest at least some weight on a hidden protuberance. "Besides, nothing\'s changed. The plan\'s still the same.'
p1315
aS'This is the best lead for finding a way back to our side."'
p1316
aS'"Are you not paying attention?" he hissed, furious. "Something is trying to kill us."'
p1317
aS'"So let\'s figure out how to stop it." I tried to keep my tone reasonable. "We\'re halfway down already. Climbing back up will be rough, regardless. Why not get all the way to the bottom first?"'
p1318
aS'"Because we don\'t even know if there is a bottom." His face was blotched red with fury, with sweat, with the scorching heat of the air. "Halfway? We have no fucking idea how deep this goes. I should have said this a long time ago.'
p1319
aS'You\'re obsessed. You get obsessed a lot, man, let it drag you down. Your stupid records." He took a deep breath. "Well now you\'re obsessed with this place, and it\'s blinding you. It\'s _feeding_ on you, your obsessions. Multiplying them.'
p1320
aS'You can\'t see it, or maybe you don\'t want to, but I do. I\'m looking right at it. Like the gorilla in the crowd."'
p1321
aS'I was angry. "If I\'m obsessed with anything, it\'s with finding a way back. We\'re running out of time. We either figure this out, or we\'re stuck here forever, in the wrong universe. We need each other to get through this."'
p1322
aS'"You\'re obsessed with me, too," he muttered. "When was the last time you hung out with someone else?"\n\n"When was the last time you did?"'
p1323
aS'He shook his head angrily, dismissing this.'
p1324
aS'"Our housemates," I pushed, "when was the last time you hung out with any of them? Anyone other than me?" He stared back, seething. "Their names. I bet you can\'t even remember their names." I was bluffing. But could I remember them, either?'
p1325
aS"Names, faces. No. There was nothing. None of those people mattered, not to me, not to us. We were the only thing that mattered. Getting back to where we'd been, what we'd had. What I'd wanted."
p1326
aS'He shook his head again, violent, like there was something inside it he wanted to dislodge. "You\'re living in a fantasy," he spat, "you always have been. _I can\'t be what you want me to be, okay?_'
p1327
aS'I can\'t be what anyone fucking wants me to be. You all have these versions of me in your head, these ideal perfect Nikos, but they\'re not real. They\'re not real. I can\'t live up to them."'
p1328
aS'He opened his eyes, stared yearningly back up the shaft. "Help me. If you really care about me, help me back up. Don\'t be like everyone else. Don\'t just fucking _use_ me to get what you want."'
p1329
aS'"Going back\'s not going to help. There\'s no answers up there." He wasn\'t understanding. I reached for something else. "Those headaches aren\'t going away. You think you can live with that pain? Forever?"'
p1330
aS'"Better than being fucking dead!" He seemed to realize I wasn\'t changing my mind, turned away to reach for a handhold, but there was nothing there, nothing to grip, and he scrabbled pathetically at the slime.'
p1331
aS'"Is it?" I shouted, angry, desperate. I had to say something, something that would make him stay, keep him here, and my mouth raced ahead of me. "You won\'t make it, up there, not with pain like that. We both know you won\'t."'
p1332
aS'He tensed, glared down at me. "What the fuck is that supposed to mean?"'
p1333
aS'"You know exactly what it means," I said, shaking. "Never really helped you. I\'ve done nothing but help you. I\'ve always been there for you. Every fucking time you fall I pick you back up. _You\'d be dead if it weren\'t for me._"'
p1334
aS'He shot me with a gaze of such cold fury I cringed. "You\'re fucking poison," he hissed, "you know that? A fucking snake. I wish you\'d let me die that night. I wish we\'d never met. _Let go of me!_"'
p1335
aS'And his hand did close on something, and he pulled himself up, triumphant.'
p1336
aS"His leg was slipping out of my hands, and I couldn't bear for him to crawl away from me, couldn't handle the thought of going back up to that world, to any world where everything was wrong and nothing I wanted was possible, so I pulled."
p1337
aS"I pulled, too hard, and both his hands slipped, and he crashed back into me, only I wasn't holding onto anything but him any more so both of us tumbled down,"
p1338
aS'faster and faster, slipping and twisting and scraping together down the steepening blood-hot slope, down and down and down into darkness.'

p1345
aS"brushing up against me, and then the lights switch off and she grabs me and I realize it's a setup, she got someone to stay out there and flip the switch: and in the sudden gloom she grabs me and crushes her lips against mine."
p1346
aS"And all I can think of in this moment is all the guys this could have been, friends I'd been too shy to get close to,"
p1347

p1349

p1350
aS"failed some future boy and myself and even this girl, whose eyes I can't meet as I pull away and brush past her out of the closet and past snickering faces to the door outside, changed, maybe, or maybe not."
p1351
aS"Her hair was in the way, after all, long straight blonde strands of it tasting like strawberry conditioner, so our lips didn't really even touch, let alone tongues. Was that a kiss? Did it count? Who knows."
p1352
aS"I don't feel like it should, and anyway I don't feel any different except maybe worse, somewhere deep down, even less experienced and less ready and less sure of who I'm supposed to be. I drop out of band not long after that."

aS"I've always liked listening to music more than playing it, anyway, and I like to listen alone."

p1355
aS'My scrabbling hands could find nothing to push against but churning water, and for a few awful seconds I panicked, thrashing; and then my face broke the surface and I gasped, slipping and struggling to my feet. Water came up to my waist.'
p1356
aS'I wiped rank muck off my face, blinked burning eyes open, tried to catch my breath.'
p1357
aS'It was utterly dark. All I could hear was splashing water.'
p1358
aS'"Niko?" I shouted.\n\nNothing.'
p1359
aS'I shrugged off my pack, zipped it open with blind, shaking fingers while struggling to keep it above the waterline, and fumbled around inside. My hand closed on a plastic tube. Glowstick. I pulled it out and snapped it, shook it, frantic.'
p1360
aS'A dim blue glow began to bring the world back, a breath at a time. Churning water was everywhere, white and frothy. Steam swayed. A few steps away a sheer angled shaft climbed back up, lined in oozing black gunk and coursing fluid.'
p1361
aS"The one we'd slid down, presumably. Turning all the way around, the edges of my dim circle of light suggested level hallways, flooded, leading off into darkness in three directions.\n\nNo sign of Niko."
p1362
aS'Shutting my eyes, I tried to sort through the confusion of the sliding fall. We had tumbled, together at first, my hands grabbing for his slime-drenched shirt, the sodden edges of his pack. But there was nothing to get a grip on.'
p1363
aS"After those first few moments all I could feel was my own tangled rope, the pasty mulch sliding past me. I assumed I'd gotten ahead of him, or behind."
p1364
aS"But what if I hadn't? What if he'd managed to stop himself again behind me, wedged himself into another kink in the tunnel?\n\nOr what if the tunnel had split, somewhere up there?"
p1365
aS"I didn't want to think about the third possibility, but I spent a few grim minutes duck-walking through the water, old rescue swim lessons running through my head, feeling my hands through the muck beneath the churning surface."
p1366
aS'I found nothing solid. No backpack, no rope. No body.'
p1367
aS"He wasn't here. I was alone."
p1368
aS'Everything in my pack was soaked. I threw out a waterlogged sandwich and watched it drift in the churning current before vanishing beneath the foam, as if someone hungry underneath had grabbed it.'
p1369
aS"I'd lost a crampon in the fall and couldn't find it, so I took off the other one and maneuvered it into my pack. The blue light from the glowstick turned everything the same shades. Black and blue."
p1370
aS'I had no idea if the dripping gun would still work, and was seized by a thick fear now of firing it down here---of how far that sound would carry and what it might attract---but I slipped it into my belt anyway.'
p1371
aS"It still didn't make me feel safe but I tried to pretend it did."
p1372
aS'My flashlight wouldn\'t turn on, even with fresh batteries. "Water resistant," according to the package, but I imagined it had been subjected to an environment outside factory test conditions.'
p1373
aS"I strapped it to the top of my pack anyway, hoping it might dry out and be useful again. I had a dozen waterproof glowsticks, so I wasn't immediately worried about light."
p1374
aS"_But a countdown's started, hasn't it? Tick, tock, tick._"
p1375
aS"I stared up the shaft we'd tumbled down for a long time, considering. Climbing back up---without a rope, with only one crampon, without someone helping me---seemed impossible."
p1376
aS"I tried to picture Niko up there somewhere, struggling to pull himself back up, handhold by slippery handhold. If he made it to the top, he'd throw another rope down to me.\n\nWouldn't he?"
p1377
aS'I waited a long time, as long as I could stand it. It might have only been a few hours, maybe even less. But it grew more and more maddening to simply stand there, soaked through, bathed in steam and sweat, doing nothing.'
p1378
aS"Wondering if he was trying to find me. Wondering if he'd left me behind. Wondering if he was drowning or dead or lost, somewhere in this maze."
p1379
aS"I thought about what he'd said to me, what I'd said to him. But I couldn't get a grip on it. The words kept slipping away. I couldn't process them. Not then."
p1380
aS"At last I decided to move. If he'd made it back up, he could take care of himself. And if he was down here somewhere, maybe I could find him. Offer help, if he needed it. If he'd take it."
p1381
aS"Anyway hadn't I said it would be silly to make it all the way here and not explore?"
p1382
aS"It was the deepest we'd been yet. Maybe there were answers down here. Or at least another way out."
p1383
aS'I picked a flooded hallway, took out my keys and gouged a crude arrow into the shitty paint of the wall, drywall dust spilling out. Breadcrumbs, to find my way back.'
p1384
aS"Or show Niko where I'd gone, if he was lost down here too, or came looking for me.\n\n_And if something else comes looking, you're pointing it right at you._"
p1385
aS'But there was nothing to be done about that. I gave the shaft back up one last doleful look, then turned to the hallway and began to push my way forward through the hot, sluggish water.'
p1386
aS"* * *\n\nI wandered. I'm not sure for how long. The black water's surface smoothed once I moved away from the turbulence at the bottom of the shaft, swallowed up the glowstick's dim blue light."
p1387
aS'There were no longer any curious features or unusual architecture: only an irregular grid of junctions. The infrequent side rooms were always empty.'
p1388
aS'Sometimes the floor or ceiling sloped up or down, not always in sync; so the water level would drift from ankle-deep to above my waist, and the ceiling from claustrophically low to beyond the reach of my light.'
p1389
aS"The halls trended wider and narrower, too, in unpredictable rhythms. I worried for a while about stepping into a pit I couldn't see and dunking myself again, but there weren't any. Nor were there stairs, up or down, or even light fixtures."
p1390
aS'Only hallways, branching, recombining, endless.'
p1391
aS'The air stayed steamy, and while the water cooled as I moved farther from the hot inlet stream it was still uncomfortably warm. I felt hot and clammy, thick-headed.'
p1392
aS'Mist swirled in the air, sculpting the dim blue light into strange shapes and shadows.'
p1393
aS"I kept gouging arrows into the wall with a key, kept moving. If I kept moving I wouldn't have to stop, wouldn't have to think."
p1394
aS'Walking takes almost no thinking at all.'
p1395
aS'* * *\n\nI came to another spot where the hallway widened, but this was different. Running along the indentation in one wall was a row of pay phones.\n\nI slowed to a stop and stared, wondering if they were really there.'
p1396
aS'They rose from knee-deep water, six of them each on its own steel pole.'
p1397
aS"The ceiling had risen so high my glowstick couldn't find it, but light stabbed down from somewhere, spotlighting each phone fierce and bright after hours of flat blue glow."
p1398
aS"Water sloshed as I trudged over to the nearest phone, reluctant but intrigued. Pay phones don't normally live inside a house. Did that mean something?"
p1399
aS'I touched the black plastic of the receiver. It felt grimy and cold. As if in a dream, I lifted it, held it to my ear.\n\nDial tone.'
p1400
aS"I blinked as it droned in my ear. This didn't make sense. If there was no power this far down, surely there weren't phone lines either."
p1401
aS"Some telecom grunt hadn't run a cable all the way down here, snaking it through all these endless halls and vertical shafts, had they? Hope they billed by the hour.\n\nThe sound of the dial tone was uncomfortably familiar."
p1402
aS'Without meaning to, I reached out a finger and dialed a number from an old commercial jingle. Seven sing-song digits.\n\nA voice told me to insert fifty cents.'
p1403
aS"I almost laughed at this familiar banality. I slapped my pockets, but had no change. I hadn't expected to need any.\n\nI put down the receiver, lifted it again and dialed zero, still not really expecting anything would happen."
p1404
aS'After a ring, a woman\'s voice: "Operator."'
p1405
aS'My bluff had been called. I didn\'t know what to say. "Er... I\'d, uh, like to make a collect call."'
p1406
aS'"Please hang up, dial star nine seven, then the number you wish to call. Say your name at the first tone."\n\n"Thanks," I managed.'
p1407
aS"She was gone. The silence hung oppressive in her absence. I needed a voice back on that line. With a couple words she'd made the familiar loneliness unbearable."
p1408
aS'But who could I call? Water sloshed around my knees as I considered the utter inexplicability of my situation. Should I call the police, explain I was lost in my own basement, miles from the surface?'
p1409
aS'Ask the fire department to send a rescue team through my bed, down the vertical hallway, and throw a rope ladder into the slimy tube in the giant bathroom?'
p1410
aS'Or maybe I\'d call a friend. You know, one who\'d believe me, who wouldn\'t hang up thirty seconds into my story. In the movies, whenever someone says "You wouldn\'t believe me if I told you," there\'s always someone to say back: "Try me."'
p1411
aS'This person invariably turns out to be surprisingly open-minded.'
p1412
aS'I knew with grim certainty this was not going to work for me. The only friend I had like that was Niko. And he was gone.\n\nI felt desperately alone.'
p1413
aS'My fingers brushed against the dial pad, hesitating. They punched star nine seven and then kept going, tracing out a familiar pattern, a groove deep in muscle memory. My fingers knew it well.\n\nAt the first tone, I said my name.'
p1414
aS'Something clicked and whirred in the receiver. A pause, and then, a ring.\n\nAnother.'
p1415
aS'Another.\n\nSomeone picked up and said, "Hello?"'
p1416
aS'"Mom." Relief flooded through me like adrenaline. You trust a voice like that on a primitive level, instinctual, in parts of your brain deeper than logic, than thought.'
p1417
aS'She must have heard something in my tone. "Honey? What\'s wrong?"'
p1418
aS'"What, I only call you when something\'s wrong?" But my eyes were tearing up and my hands were trembling. I held the phone tight against my face. It smelled like old sweat and institutional cleaner.'
p1419
aS'With my other hand I wiped my forehead. Swallowed. "Nothing\'s wrong. Just wanted to hear your voice. How are things? Tell me what you\'re up to." I didn\'t care what she said. I only wanted her to talk and keep on talking.'
p1420
aS"To hear sounds from a normal world and pretend I was part of it. That I'd ever been part of it."
p1421
aS"She humored me for a minute, but I could tell she was worried. And I couldn't think of anything to say that would get me out of here."
p1422
aS'"Alright, star man," she finally said, and my brain flashed to my sixth birthday when she dressed up like an astronaut to bring in my cake. Cr\xc3\xaape paper planets and glow-in-the-dark comets. "Fess up. What\'s going on?"'
p1423
aS'"I\'m... I\'m in trouble, mom." My voice was breaking. "Something\'s happened. You remember my... my friend Niko?" I rushed forward, babbling. "I\'ve lost him, mom, I don\'t know where he is, where either of us are.'
p1424
aS'I fucked things up and I don\'t know what to do. This is too big, all of this is too big, and I... I made a mistake, and..."'
p1425
aS"I bit my lip so I'd stop talking, something pressing down hard on my chest, and gripped the phone like it was my last anchor to reality. Maybe it was."
p1426
aS'She took a deep breath. Let it out.'
p1427
aS'"Oh, honey," she said. "Is it... is it AIDS?"'
p1428
aS'Of all the things to be terrified about right then, that one was so far down the list that my brain sort of tripped over itself, downshifted straight back to first and stalled the hell out. "Oh," I said. "Uh. What? No. No, it\'s not AIDS.'
p1429
aS'Mom. I wouldn\'t tell you something like that over the phone." I took a deep breath, and once again said something I probably shouldn\'t have. I said it with deadly seriousness. "It\'s HIV."\n\nThere was an awful silence.'
p1430
aS"Then I started giggling. I couldn't help myself."
p1431
aS'"That\'s not funny, Orion," she said, but then she was laughing too, and neither of us could stop, even when she kept trying to, kept saying "Orion" again in her serious voice which just set me off more, which set her off again too.'
p1432
aS"And if I could have given anything to stretch that moment out forever, I'd have done it in a heartbeat."
p1433
aS'I wiped tears from the corners of my eyes. "I\'m sorry. No, it\'s not that. I can\'t really explain it. I guess I just needed to hear your voice more than anything. I\'ll... figure something out."'
p1434
aS'"That\'s my smartie." I could picture her expression when she said this; she\'d said it a lot. "You\'re sure it\'s nothing I can help with?"'
p1435
aS'"I\'m sure." The blue monochrome of the glowstick made the pay phone into an artsy abstraction; the blackness around me sucked away all the rest of its light.'
p1436
aS'"Well, you\'ll figure it out." She sounded less worried than I expected, and for some reason I took comfort in that. "You know you can always ask for help when you need to. But you won\'t always need to. And that\'s okay."'
p1437
aS'Tears were pushing out of my eyes again, damn it. I leaned against the booth, screwing them shut. "Thanks, mom," I whispered.'
p1438
aS'"I love you, sweetie," she said. "Do you want to talk to Bradley?"'
p1439
aS'And out of everything that had happened, all the unexplained and terrifying and gut-wrenching things, nothing hit me like those words did. Sometimes words hit harder than a slap. You feel them, like ten thousand volts.'
p1440
aS"They sour everything that came before, ruin everything coming after. That's how those words hit me."
p1441
aS'"What?" I managed, my voice small.'
p1442
aS'"He was helping us shop for your sister\'s prom, remember? The three of us had a blast. Hang on, I\'ll put him on."\n\nI stood clutching the phone, unable to move, to breathe.'
p1443
aS'Faint rustling sounds came over the line.\n\n"Hey, gorgeous."'
p1444
aS"There are some voices you hope you'll never hear again. When a person bends you so far you snap, you can usually forget about the piece of you that broke off, until something reminds you of the splintered edge where more of you used to be."
p1445
aS'When people die or move away or betray you and you tuck your thoughts of them out of sight like a forgotten photo album,'
p1446
aS"it's a shock when the book is dragged back out, the pages wrenched open, frozen moments shoved unwanted toward your face."
p1447
aS"The stylus of a record player is a needle, dragged along a ragged surface to conjure ghosts of long-ago sounds: instruments, rhythms. Voices. If you don't consent to be played, the needle hurts."
p1448
aS'"Brad." I didn\'t know what else to say.'
p1449
aS'"You will not believe this dress we found for Sarah." I could hear his mischievous smile, the sound of the glints in his eyes. His tone was light and playful and casual. Like we\'d last spoken yesterday. Like nothing had ever been wrong.'
p1450
aS'"Brad," I said again, "what the fuck are you doing at my mom\'s house?"'
p1451
aS'"Oh, you know, casing the joint," he said breezily. "Your mom has a lot of good stuff. Is it okay if I just say \'mom?\' _She\'s_ been saying My Second Son all day, so it\'s kind of awkward if I don\'t.'
p1452
aS'Oh my god, Orion, does she know something I don\'t?"'
p1453
aS'"What?" I felt weak.'
p1454
aS'"This mysterious camping trip," he teased. "Wanting everything to be perfect. Don\'t worry, babe, I\'m good at pretending to be surprised."'
p1455
aS'"What are you talking about?" I sounded like an idiot but I couldn\'t help myself. Nothing made sense. This conversation was out of its groove, the needle scratching across the surface, leaving an ugly mark that could never be buffed out.'
p1456
aS'How could he act like everything was fine, after all that had happened? Like any of this was normal?\n\n_Maybe in this universe, it was._'
p1457
aS"This had never once occurred to me since I'd passed through to this side. It was too huge a change. All the differences were so tiny, so inconsequential. Not like this."
p1458
aS"I couldn't conceive of what my life would have been like, if we'd never inscribed those wounds on each other. If we'd stayed whole. Who would I even have become? Who would he?\n\n_Or._"
p1459
aS"_Maybe it's not him at all._"
p1460
aS"Something inside me withdrew, to wherever small animals go in their heads while staring down looming headlights. Some residual part of me thought I ought to move, speak, react. Get out of the way. But I didn't know how."
p1461
aS'"So is this super-secret message part of the whole thing?" He still sounded playful, flirty. "All this stuff about _going deeper_?"'
p1462
aS'My blood was frozen and my mouth had gone dry. "What?"'
p1463
aS'"When you called last night," he explained, voice still achingly familiar, "so secretive. You said next time we talked I was supposed to remind you that you need to go deeper." I could hear him raising his eyebrows, somehow, seductive.'
p1464
aS'"I\'m not opposed, dear, although maybe we shouldn\'t talk about this"---he dropped into a stage whisper---"when your mother\'s in the other room."\n\n"I didn\'t talk to you yesterday."'
p1465
aS'The ground felt like it was dropping away.'
p1466
aS'"I wrote it down because it was so weird." I could hear the rustle of a paper: I could see him, squinting through his glasses. "I\'m supposed to say that you\'re not deep enough yet, and you need to keep going down. Deeper and deeper.'
p1467
aS'As deep as you can get." He cleared his throat meaningfully. "I mean you know I\'m all for going down in general, babe, but seriously, what\'s the deal?"'
p1468
aS'"I don\'t... I can\'t..." There were so many things I wanted to say to him. Fear and anger and a homesick longing for places that can\'t be returned to were churning around inside me. I couldn\'t accept this.'
p1469
aS"I didn't know if I could even survive it."
p1470
aS'"Babe," he said, "what\'s wrong? You\'re being weird."\n\n"I loved you," I whispered.'
p1471
aS'"I love you, too," he said, mishearing, and then something spasmed inside me, my lungs locking up like in a cramp, refusing to breathe. My vision closed down to a tunnel. My fingers went numb.'
p1472
aS'I dropped the phone. It swung on the end of its metal coil, spinning slowly. I could still hear his voice, faint and distorted---\n\n"Ryan?"'
p1473
aS'---Bradley\'s voice, drifting faint from those tiny holes in the receiver, as I backed away, staring---\n\n"Orion? Are you there?"'
p1474
aS"---and my shoulders hit the wall, and I couldn't back away any more but I could still hear his voice coming out of the receiver, so I pulled out my gun and shot it."
p1475
aS"Somehow I hit the dangling receiver on my first shot, and it exploded. Tiny bits of plastic shrapnel cut the air. One whizzed past my cheek and sliced it open. I didn't notice."
p1476
aS"I raised the gun to the boxy metal body of the phone and shot that, too. I shot it again and again until the gun wouldn't fire any more."
p1477
aS'My ears hurt. The reverberations were deafening, echoing endlessly.'
p1478
aS'I pictured compressed sound waves expanding through miles of hallways, like a dangerous thought lighting up more and more neurons, bouncing off skullbone to keep reflecting, multiplying, feeding on itself.'
p1479
aS'A sound crashing up staircases and down shafts in rippling patterns of interference and reinforcement. I stared down at the gun in my hand, thoughts dull, shots ringing and echoing in my head and through the halls.'
p1480
aS'I unclenched my hand and the gun fell into the water, vanishing under the surface without a splash.\n\nThe phone made a distinct, metallic _clunk_.'
p1481
aS'I looked up at its bullet-riddled surface.'
p1482
aS"Inside, something was tumbling down through the pay phone's innards, dinging and plinking past metal obstructions. My gaze moved down, following its invisible path through the body of the phone."
p1483
aS'Finally, the clattering stopped. The gate of the coin return jiggled as something clunked into the slot behind it.'
p1484
aS'Not wanting to, I edged forward. Part of me reached out while another part tried in horror to call my hand back, but it kept moving. It pushed the gate open.\n\nIn the coin return was a small brass key.'
p1485
aS'I stared at it for a long moment. Then I snatched the key and pulled back, turning away from the bank of phones in the same movement. I slogged fiercely on through the water and down the hall, moving fast, not looking back.'
p1486
aS"My ears still rang with gunshots. In the silence, that ring kept sounding almost like a distant telephone, bell clanging somewhere far behind me. I tried to ignore them, but the ghost sounds didn't fade for hours."
p1487
aS'Chapter 11\n\nIn a flooded side room half the floor had rotted away. Water cascaded down into consuming blackness, no lower level visible.'
p1488
aS'I stepped carefully past the open door and the strong current rushing in, tide sucking my shins like it was hungry for them, and sloshed away fast up the hall, shuddering at the thought of that black pit.'
p1489
aS"You fell into that thing, God knows where you'd land."
p1490
aS'Soon after, the hall began sloping up. The carpet went from wet to damp, and then, between one step and the next, dry.'
p1491
aS'Up ahead glimmered a tiny spark of yellow. I stumbled closer: a night-light, plugged into an outlet at the base of the wall. Something about it whispered of lightning bugs and sleepy summer nights, and all at once I felt immensely weary.'
p1492
aS'I fell to my knees when I reached the weak light and sloughed off my waterlogged pack, then curled up around the tiny pale glow as if it was a campfire.'
p1493
aS'My face snuggled into the brown whorls of the carpet like the fur of some huge indifferent beast. I slept.'
p1494
aS'My body did, anyway. My mind kept marching.'
p1495
aS"I dreamed endless waterlogged halls. I trudged. I can't say I explored, because I no longer made any attempt to mark my way or track my position. I searched for nothing, found nothing: just wandered."
p1496
aS'When I realized I was dreaming I tried to break free of the nightmare, but lucidity was slippery, fumbled away between heartbeats, and I kept losing it.'
p1497
aS"I walked halls lit only by my flickering sea-blue light and thought of nothing that wasn't them.\n\nOnce, in a long, straight hall of waist-deep water that never seemed to end, the surface ahead of me shifted, swirled."
p1498
aS'Something moved underneath.'
p1499
aS'I stopped short, squinting, and held my glowstick high. The ripples flung its dim light back to me, bunched up and distorted. But I could make out something person-shaped under the surface, swimming toward me.'
p1500
aS"The gun was in my hand: in this dream, I'd forgotten I lost it. Gripped by fear, I aimed it at the thing under the surface and pulled the trigger. But the shots went wide, from the angle of the water or some grim nightmare-logic."
p1501
aS'Whatever it was kept coming.'
p1502
aS"I cringed back against the wall. The thing beneath the water was doing the breaststroke with smooth, efficient moves. It didn't break the surface and it never came up for air. Through the rippled distortions I could see no face."
p1503
aS'But as it swam past, ignoring me, I could see it was wearing my clothes.'
p1504
aS"It didn't slow down. I pressed my back against the wall, cold sweat prickling on my face, helpless to stop my head turning to watch it pass."
p1505
aS'It swam to the end of the hall and around a corner, never stopping for breath, leaving a wake of dark whorls and eddies.'
p1506
aS'* * *\n\nI woke with a parched, sticky mouth. My face was glued to the carpet with dried blood from where the piece of phone had cut my cheek. I tugged myself free, which reopened the cut.'
p1507
aS"Wincing, I sat up and rummaged in my waterlogged pack for something to staunch the bleeding, still half-asleep. I'd left my soaked shoes on and my feet felt like they'd swelled to twice their normal size inside them."
p1508
aS"My glowstick had long since burnt out. The nightlight's weak yellow glow reduced the world to a dim circle of carpet, a few feet across. And I was groggy, still shaking dream-remnants from my head."
p1509
aS"So I didn't realize until I started digging for a fresh glowstick that someone was sitting a few feet away."
p1510
aS'I gasped and leapt up, scrabbling back against the wall behind me. I could see only tennis shoes, catching the amber edge of the nightlight, and the faintest hint of a body in the shadows behind them, knees pulled up with clasping hands.'
p1511
aS'Someone sitting with their back against the wall, faint yellow glints in two eyes. Watching.'
p1512
aS"I stayed there trembling for a moment, too afraid to either come closer or flee into the blackness back the way I'd come. I'd left my pack in the circle of light, between me and whoever was sitting beyond it."
p1513
aS'I realized I recognized the shoes.'
p1514
aS'Hesitant, I cleared my throat. "Niko?"'
p1515
aS'The face was so shadowed I could barely make it out, but I thought it smiled. "Hey, man."'
p1516
aS'The voice was cracked, weak. But familiar. Unmistakable.'
p1517
aS'I stepped back toward the light. "Shit, dude, you scared me." He made no move to get up. "What happened to you? We got separated and I didn\'t know what to do. Did you find the arrows I left? Jesus, I\'m glad you found me."'
p1518
aS'I knelt and pulled a new glowstick from my pack, but he held up a hand.'
p1519
aS'"Okay if we talk for a minute first, like this?" he said. "Been in the dark for fucking ever and that thing will murder my eyes." He lowered the hand. "Cool?"'
p1520
aS'It was such a relief to hear his voice again I shoved the glowstick back down, along with a vague sense of unease. "Fine. So what happened?"'
p1521
aS'"Rather hear what happened to you. Tell me everything."'
p1522
aS"So I did. How I'd waited at the bottom of the shaft, explored the water-soaked hallways. I told him about the call at the bank of payphones."
p1523
aS"But I left out the part with the gun, because in hindsight it felt stupid, and because I remembered he didn't know about the gun, and I didn't want to mar our reunion by revealing I'd kept something from him. Something else, anyway."
p1524
aS"He didn't say much. The yellow glints bobbed at times like he was nodding or cocking his head. But the darkness was fierce. All I could really make out were his shoes, and the hands clasped around his knees."
p1525
aS'In the pale yellow of the night-light they looked skeletal, emaciated.'
p1526
aS"Disquiet crept into me, rising through the floor into my feet and up my bones. I couldn't see his face. I wanted to."
p1527
aS'"Hey," I finally said, "this dark is kind of freaking me out. You can shield your eyes or whatever, but I\'ve got to have some light. Okay?"'
p1528
aS'He sighed, as if resigned. "If you have to."'
p1529
aS'I reached carefully for a glowstick the same way I used to walk deliberately towards the light switch in my childhood basement, shepherding growing panic with a forced front of calm.'
p1530
aS'I pulled one out, snapped it, shook it, blinked at the surge of orange light from mingling chemicals, and held it up, anxious, as the light crept toward him.'
p1531
aS"The electric orange was shockingly bright, and he'd winced and held up a hand to block it out. He kept it there for a long moment as I squinted, pupils squirming. Finally, almost reluctant, he dropped the hand and met my gaze, defiant."
p1532
aS'Something was wrong with him.'
p1533
aS'He was changed. Distorted. Something had leathered him, shrunken and withered his features, hollowed his eye sockets. At first he seemed like some poorly made caricature, face a twisted copy of the one I knew so well.'
p1534
aS'But then I started to realize what had happened to him.\n\nTime.'
p1535
aS'He was older. Much older.'
p1536
aS"I was still in the shallows of my twenties, remember. I hadn't been around long enough to see how age inscribes itself on people, crumples parents into grandparents and invalids and corpses."
p1537
aS"I hadn't seen friends lose hair and teeth and muscle tone. I hadn't loved someone long enough to find out what decades do."
p1538
aS'The Niko against the wall looked twice as old as he should have been, maybe more. He was wearing different clothes, but out of his standard wardrobe: the bowling shirt with "My Name Is BONG" on the lapel. It wasn\'t threadbare or faded.'
p1539
aS'Something bulged from the front pocket, maybe a penlight, and his pack leaned against the wall beside him.'
p1540
aS'He held my gaze, waiting. We stared at each other for a long time.'
p1541
aS'I finally broke the silence. "What happened?"'
p1542
aS'He took a breath. Let it out. "You can see what happened." He cleared his throat. I realized now he wasn\'t tired, or strained. His voice was just older. "So. Yeah. I\'m not your Niko, man. Okay? I\'ve been through more. A lot more."'
p1543
aS'I stiffened. "You\'re... from the other side?"'
p1544
aS'He smiled. "Ah. You still think there\'s just two sides. Sure, course you do." He shook his head. "Guess that\'s how it seems near the surface. A pair of possibilities. Neat. But deeper down, things get more... _tangled_."'
p1545
aS'The word sounded heavy in his throat, dangerous.'
p1546
aS'"What do you mean?" I couldn\'t stop staring at his face, and I swayed with the sick feeling of recognition and strangeness, curdled together in that fierce orange light.'
p1547
aS'"There\'s a lot of space down here, Orion. A lot of... possibilities. Most of them aren\'t good." His glance had drifted down the corridor, but now it snapped back to my face. "_My_ Ryan and I, we got lost. Long time ago. Real fucking lost.'
p1548
aS'Never made it back."'
p1549
aS'"Your Ryan?" I looked around, panic spiking. "There\'s some older version of me down here too?"'
p1550
aS'He looked away. "No."'
p1551
aS"After a moment, I realized he wasn't going to say anything else. And then why."
p1552
aS'His eyes flicked back to mine again, as if fascinated by them. He stared with something like hunger. At seeing my face again? At seeing anyone?'
p1553
aS'"Been on my own a long time," he said, as if explaining. "Gotten used to it."'
p1554
aS'Suddenly I couldn\'t accept any of this. "Your clothes." I shook my head. "Your shoes. No. They haven\'t changed. They should be worn down to nothing."'
p1555
aS'He looked away again, out into the blackness down the hall. "Like I said. Lot of possibilities." He cracked a knuckle. "We weren\'t the only ones who got lost. Bumped into lots of other Nikos and Ryans down here over the years.'
p1556
aS'Most of them dead. Sorry to say." He cracked another knuckle, methodical. "But the clothes are fine, man. The clothes fit great." He forced out a barking laugh, abrupt and cold.'
p1557
aS'I wondered how long it had taken his laugh to shrivel down to that emaciated sound.'
p1558
aS'He sniffed. "You get used to it. Stealing clothes. I mean there\'s no Penney\'s down here, so..."'
p1559
aS'"But how do you eat?" I felt angry, not the least because my skin was crawling at the thought of him grave-robbing other Nikos. Other Ryans. "If you\'ve been down here so long, how the hell are you even alive? It doesn\'t make any sense."'
p1560
aS'He turned back to me again, no longer wistful but with dangerous sharpness. Maybe you\'ve heard the phrase "thousand-yard stare" and maybe you\'ve even seen one before, but I hadn\'t. It _struck_ me.'
p1561
aS'I believed everything he said next, no matter how fantastic. The words were only flavoring on the truth in that stare.'
p1562
aS'"There\'s a room," he began, voice graveling, "not much farther down from here. Different from anything up here. Bigger. A bit bigger." That laugh again.'
p1563
aS'"Can\'t walk the length of one of its walls without stopping to sleep. Takes five or six sleeps to walk all the way around, keeping the outer wall to your left the whole time. Passing all the doors." He shook his head.'
p1564
aS'"Maybe a few thousand halls leading out. Most of them slanting upward. But only one goes back to the surface. The rest lead nowhere, or in circles, back to one of the other ten thousand halls.'
p1565
aS'He took a breath. "When you come into this room, though, you can tell something\'s different. The carpet ends. It turns to asphalt."'
p1566
aS'He stood up so quick I cringed back, but turned to the wall and placed a hand on it. He drew his finger down, then over and around, drawing an invisible square; then drew invisible grid lines in it. "Asphalt," he said. "City streets.'
p1567
aS'City blocks. A huge grid of them. Suburban streets. Crosswalks, stop signs, you know. What you\'d expect. Lawns, but they\'re all dead. No sun, right?"'
p1568
aS'He turned back, leaned against the wall. "And all the houses," he said, fixing me with that stare again, "are ours."'
p1569
aS'"What?" I couldn\'t break his gaze.'
p1570
aS'He shrugged. "Not exactly. None exactly. But all close enough. Sometimes the foyer\'s a mirror image, or the front door\'s changed, or there\'s one more bedroom on the second floor, one less.'
p1571
aS"Or the carpet's different, or the wallpaper, or the kitchen's smaller or there's no bricked up fireplace, or the fireplace is bigger, or there's a fish tank instead of a fireplace."
p1572
aS'Sometimes, maybe one in ten houses, I can\'t see a difference. But I think it\'s always there. Not that I\'ve checked them all." He laughed again. "Did the math once. There\'s ten million houses. Give or take. I\'ve been down here a long time.'
p1573
aS'But not that long.'
p1574
aS'"Each one has that upstairs porch room, though," he went on, relentless. "Your room. And they\'re all filled with your stuff. Little variations again. Sometimes your bookshelf has a copy of _Dhalgren_, sometimes it doesn\'t.'
p1575
aS"That one I always look for. But it's your room, in every house. And your bed."
p1576
aS'"And under every one of those beds, there\'s another Downstairs, as big as this one. And if you can find your way down, another huge empty city with another ten million houses. Each slightly different.'
p1577
aS"Each slightly different than the ten million up here. And sometimes, other Ryans and Nikos come up out of them, expecting to find the real world, with people and a sun and all. They're real fucking disappointed."
p1578
aS"Especially when they wander too far and can't find the house they came out of again."
p1579
aS'"Sometimes I\'ll meet them on the streets, crying, panicked. I stay away, of course. Can\'t get too close, like you know, or. Bad things happen."'
p1580
aS'He pointed to his temples, and I flashed back to that feeling of wrongness when my double and I had almost bumped into each other.'
p1581
aS'He looked away. "Course they\'re usually dead by the time I find them," he added lightly. "But. Your question. Each house has a pantry, food.'
p1582
aS"Once in a while one has power, too, lit up like Christmas in all that dark, and the fridge is running and cold, and there's lunchmeat and milk and leftovers inside. Unspoiled. So there's plenty to eat. Just not a lot of, you know."
p1583
aS'Ambiance."'
p1584
aS'He stepped closer. "I heard your gunshots. That\'s how I found you. Don\'t know what you were shooting at but doesn\'t matter. _You\'re not lost._ Are you." He glanced behind me, back the way I\'d come. "This goes back up, doesn\'t it?'
p1585
aS'To the surface. The real surface." He closed his eyes. "With light and birds, and grass, and people who aren\'t you or me. I can\'t tell you..."'
p1586
aS"He opened them again and I wanted to shrink back, close my eyes and pretend I'd never seen something like that in human eyes, let alone in his, that hollowness and pain and something else, too, something worse. But I couldn't."
p1587
aS'I could only stare back, cringing.'
p1588
aS'"I can\'t tell you," he said more quietly, "what it would mean to me to find my way back up there. Orion. I can\'t stay down here any longer. I can\'t."'
p1589
aS'Chapter 12\n\nI wanted to find my Niko, but this surrogate kept arguing against it. Impossible, he said. Like finding a needle in a haystack. Except this haystack went down forever.'
p1590
aS"In the best-case scenario, he explained patiently, we'd wander until our food ran out, then with our last dregs of energy and luck find our way back up and out, empty-handed.\n\nHe didn't mention the worst-case scenario."
p1591
aS'Decamped in a small empty side room with low ceilings and walls bulging with water damage, we argued. A single weak light bulb stuck in the center of one wall made stark shadow-men play across the other.'
p1592
aS'He insisted the smart strategy was for us to retrace my steps to the base of the slide and climb back up. "The closer to the top, the fewer possibilities," he said, "the fewer choices. And fewer chances of making the wrong one."'
p1593
aS'When he found out I hadn\'t seen my Niko since we got separated in the shaft, he grew even more convinced. "Maybe he\'s not down here at all. Maybe he caught himself on the way down, like you said, and he\'s up there now waiting for you.'
p1594
aS'Worrying." He gave up convincing me. "Or if he\'s not, he\'ll realize heading back is the smart option. I _know_ he would, buddy." He tapped his head. "Trust me."'
p1595
aS'I couldn\'t deny this plan made sense, but I felt sick. Too much was wrong. "Look. Even if I take you back up there, it won\'t be your world. You can\'t stay. If you\'re on the wrong side too long, you start to feel---detached."'
p1596
aS'I shuddered without meaning to. "Like it\'s rejecting you. Like antibodies swarming. It\'ll kill you."'
p1597
aS'He shrugged. "We don\'t know that. I\'ll risk it. Anything\'s better than staying down here."'
p1598
aS'"It\'s not just that." I felt like a coward, but desperately wanted an excuse, a reason he couldn\'t come back with us. "You know about that sick feeling when you\'re too close to a twin. That\'s even worse than the headaches.'
p1599
aS'So say we find my Niko and get you both back to the surface. Then what? The two of you get a double on campus, move in together?"'
p1600
aS'He sighed, impatient. "You think I haven\'t thought this through, all the time I\'ve had? You help me get back up, I\'m gone. It\'s a big planet. I\'ve learned how to survive. I\'ll never get within a hundred miles of either of you again."'
p1601
aS'"Wait a minute." I\'d had an idea. "That sick sensation, when you\'re too close. We can use that to find him." He raised an eyebrow. "Okay, maybe you\'re right, and there\'s too much space here to find him by dumb luck.'
p1602
aS'But you\'ve got a sixth sense for where he is. You\'re like a magnet we can move through that haystack, feeling for tugs. Any twinges and we steer closer, till we\'re close enough to do the rest by shouting."'
p1603
aS'"You\'re not listening to me, Orion." He was getting angry. He realized it, took a moment to collect himself. "There\'s a lot of space down here. You have no idea how much space. You\'re never going to find him. You need to accept that.'
p1604
aS'You\'ll get us both lost. And I\'m _sick_ of being lost, buddy. Fucking sick of it."'
p1605
aS"He had an intensity my Niko never had---though maybe there'd been something like it latent in him, waiting for the right trauma to pull it out like a loose thread. It scared me."
p1606
aS"He was right. I didn't want to get lost down here, either. I didn't want to end up like him.\n\nBut I also wasn't willing to give up on my Niko."
p1607
aS'I dug out my keys, held them up. "Look. I\'ve been using these to mark my way. There\'s no chance of getting lost. And I\'ve got plenty of food, still. For both of us. So we keep searching. Keep marking the way. Be methodical, map it out.'
p1608
aS'And if the food runs low..." My throat felt tight. "If that happens, we\'ll turn back. But I can\'t give up on him yet. I can\'t."'
p1609
aS'His eyes narrowed, and I could see him weighing something behind them.'
p1610
aS'But then his face relaxed. A huge smile broke across it, and it was so familiar, so him, that when he threw his arms around me and squeezed me tight, I hugged him back.'
p1611
aS'"Goddammit, man, you haven\'t changed at all. Okay." He pulled back, still grinning, and laughed---a real laugh, the one I remembered. "Shit. Like you\'d give me up without a fight. Course not. The fuck we waiting for, then?"'
p1612
aS'He hoisted his pack, started down the hall. "Come on, Ry," he shouted back over his shoulder, "let\'s go find me."'
p1613
aS"* * *\n\nElder Niko was obsessive about marking our way---I couldn't blame him---so we made slow progress. But despite his initial misgivings he seemed committed now to finding his younger double. Even downright cheerful about it."
p1614
aS'We slipped into something like a rhythm, despite the surreal circumstances.'
p1615
aS"He declined my offer of a glowstick, and didn't pull out the penlight or whatever from his shirt pocket, instead keeping close to me as I swung my light around, peering down all the hallways we passed."
p1616
aS"Sometimes, for a moment, I'd forget it wasn't him."
p1617
aS"Then the light would catch the hard-edged crow's feet around his eyes, or he'd ask in nostalgia-tinged tones if I remembered something that happened a week or a month ago, and reality crashed back into me."
p1618
aS'I supposed from his perspective I was like a long-lost friend at a high school reunion, so as woozy as it made me feel I could understand this behavior.\n\nI thought I could, anyway.'
p1619
aS"He didn't seem to need much light. I asked about this and he shrugged, saying he spent most of his time in total darkness. Sometimes, he said, there were long stretches between lit-up rooms, between scavenged batteries or glowsticks."
p1620
aS'My skin crawled when I imagined trying to navigate this endless labyrinth by feel, never knowing when you might step into a puddle of water, a bottomless shaft. A body.'
p1621
aS'I thought of him wandering these halls in utter darkness, face placid, eyes unfocused, fingers skimming the paneled wall, the only sound the scuff of sneakers on carpet. Sniffing for rot at hallway junctions.'
p1622
aS'Feeling on hands and knees for corpses and their backpacks of supplies, like a blind crab scavenging for leavings at the bottom of the sea. I thought of getting so used to this that it no longer seemed awful.'
p1623
aS'That it seemed perfectly normal.'
p1624
aS'The sense that he was keeping something from me, that something was wrong, only grew. He kept asking about the way back up: casually, like making conversation.'
p1625
aS"But he wanted to know what was above the slide, the layout of the rooms before that, whether we'd come through a fridge or a sliding glass door,"
p1626
aS"whether the junction before the long stairs down had eight doors or six or five, which pit exactly we'd rappelled down, whether I'd found the Bathtub Funnel, which branch I'd taken off the Big Room to get down here."
p1627
aS'He was trying to reconstruct the route back out. Maybe this made sense---maybe he was just curious, or hedging his bets in case we got split up, like I had with my Niko---but behind the jokes and easy laughter I sensed calculation. A front.'
p1628
aS'Performance.'
p1629
aS"Now and then I'd ask if he'd gotten any twinges of feeling, hints we were getting close to another Niko. He'd answer right away: Nothing. Nope. Sorry. At one point, annoyed, I demanded he stop for a minute and really try."
p1630
aS"He put on a show of being abashed, of closing his eyes and concentrating---but I could tell it was only an act. He wasn't expecting to find anyone."
p1631
aS'Like he already knew there was no one there to find.'
p1632
aS"* * *\n\nWe'd come to a maze of endless narrow rooms and hallways lined with empty shelves of all shapes and sizes, like a fractal pantry."
p1633
aS'Stairs twisted up and down through shelf-lined landings, doors opening onto endless dead-ends lined with more shelves, stained and bent from past weight but supporting nothing.'
p1634
aS'We poked around a space the size of a mansion, cluttered with oddly-sized corners and crannies, finally realizing the whole area was a dead end. There was no other way out.'
p1635
aS'"Maybe it\'s time to turn back," Elder Niko said when we realized this, solemn. We were near the back of the big cluttered space, in a long narrow dead-end with twenty-foot ceilings, flimsy shelves stretching all the way to the top.'
p1636
aS'The air was dry and smelled of dust. "Man, it\'s going to be hilarious when we find out my younger self\'s been topside this whole time. Lounging on a blanket in the backyard, you know, under the sky. Catching some rays.'
p1637
aS'Waiting for you to get out." He laughed, and his voice sounded hollow, swallowed up by endless rows of empty shelves.'
p1638
aS'His face grew more serious. "Or maybe he\'s so lost we\'ll never find him. Orion. I tried to tell you. This place is too big." He gestured around us, took a deep breath, looked chagrined. "It\'s a lost cause, buddy.'
p1639
aS'I think it\'s time to give it up."'
p1640
aS'He took a step toward the door, but I was in his way, bristling. Holding my ground.\n\nI said, "No."'
p1641
aS'He stopped, looking confused. "What\'s up?"'
p1642
aS"I couldn't explain my trembling, except for a deep-seated certainty that this was wrong."
p1643
aS'Everything about it was wrong, just generally, but a specific wrong thing was the way this place had taken Niko from me and done this to him,'
p1644
aS"made him into something I couldn't understand and didn't trust, and I couldn't stand this stalemate any more."
p1645
aS'Some yawning possibility loomed before me, like I was on my knees proposing and had no idea if the answer would be yes. But I had to know. Better to get shot down than keep wondering forever.'
p1646
aS'I met his eyes. "Tell me."\n\n"Hmm?"'
p1647
aS'"Tell me whatever it is you\'re not telling me. Tell me what\'s really going on. I want to know."'
p1648
aS'He frowned. "What do you mean?"'
p1649
aS'"Damn it, stop _pretending_. Everything is not okay. You\'re stringing me along and you need to stop it. Be honest with me."'
p1650
aS'"Oh?" His expression stayed pleasantly neutral. I could project on it anything I wanted.'
p1651
aS'"Stop playing games." I clenched my fists. "Stop _using_ me. Look, we can do this together. You need me to get out of here. Both of you do. I know the way back, and I\'ll help you, but I need to trust you. And you need to trust me. Okay?"'
p1652
aS'He nodded, looking serious, and bowed his head. Then gave himself one final nod. As if coming to a decision.\n\nHe looked up smiling, stepped forward, and punched me in the throat.'
p1653
aS'I staggered back, pain exploding from my neck, but he stepped forward at the same time, looking bored.'
p1654
aS'He punched me in the face so hard I spun sideways and slammed into the wall of shelves, something crunching in my nose, and he kept stepping forward, grabbing my wrists and kicking my feet out from under me.'
p1655
aS'He twisted my arms as I fell so I landed face first, and still he kept moving with me, descending with his knee in my back so when I hit the ground his full weight slammed down on top of me.'
p1656
aS'He punched me hard in the kidney, twice, grinding my face into the carpet with his other hand now somehow on my head.'
p1657
aS"My mouth was open but I couldn't breathe, or scream or speak or think for lack of breathing. My throat felt crushed, my lungs paralyzed. Pain like a stab wound tore open my side. I couldn't think enough to move my muscles."
p1658
aS'Never taking his weight off the knee digging into my spine, he pulled something from his bag. I heard a rip, and was so sure it was some part of myself it confused me when I felt no pain.'
p1659
aS"Something sticky wrapped around my wrists, tugging the hairs on my forearm. Duct tape. And now I did struggle, feebly trying to dislodge him, kicking my legs. Pathetic as a half-squashed bug, twitching, not realizing it's already dead."
p1660
aS"In moments he'd bound my ankles, too, and then my knees.\n\nIt had all taken maybe ten seconds."
p1661
aS'I tried to make a sound, to beg him to stop, or ask why he was doing this, but all that came out was a coarse rasp, not even a gasp. So I begged with my eyes instead.'
p1662
aS"He met my gaze, then looked away, dispassionate. He knew what I was trying to say. He didn't care."
p1663
aS'He frisked me: hands patting my ass, my pockets, my crotch. "Gun," he said, impatient, "where\'s the gun?"'
p1664
aS'I had just enough breath back to grunt a word. "Lost."'
p1665
aS'"Stupid." He cuffed the back of my head. "There\'s worse things than me down here. And worse _me_s." He smirked, but his hands had found my back pocket, felt what was inside. They reached in, urgent, and dragged out the key.'
p1666
aS'His breath caught.'
p1667
aS'He bent down and shoved it in my face, angrier now than he\'d looked while beating the shit out of me. "What\'s this? How long ago did you find this?"'
p1668
aS'My head spun, trying to think of some way to regain control. "Couple," I gasped. "Hours."'
p1669
aS'"Have you used it yet? Gone through?"'
p1670
aS"I didn't want to answer his questions, but I couldn't see how lying would help me, either. I shook my head."
p1671
aS'He stood up and slammed his fist down on a shelf, cracking the flimsy wood. Then he started to pace, furious. Thinking. I groaned and rolled partway onto my side.'
p1672
aS'The pain in my kidney was evolving from a stabbing into a roiling burning sickness, like something inside me boiled, threatened to burst. Breathing felt like forcing air through pipes sealed with rust.'
p1673
aS'"My Niko," I rasped. "Looking for me. Won\'t let you. Do this."'
p1674
aS'"Your Niko\'s dead," he said, and he said it so simply, so matter-of-fact, it sunk into me like another punch. "Found him and got rid of him before I found you. I always kill the Nikos first. Makes the headaches go away faster."'
p1675
aS'It felt like the room was dropping. I didn\'t want to believe him. I fought not to. "No," I gasped. "Bull. Shit."'
p1676
aS"He reached into his shirt pocket and pulled out what I'd thought was a penlight. It wasn't. It was a finger."
p1677
aS'He tossed it onto the carpet by my face and it rolled once, coming stiffly to rest a few inches from my eye. It was cut through at the knuckle and pale and dead. But more or less the right color.'
p1678
aS'"I\'ve killed him hundreds of times," he said, sounding bored again. He was watching me, though, and as he noticed my tears he gave them a small, sad smile, as if touched by my naivet\xc3\xa9. "And you, too, you little bitch. You\'re even easier.'
p1679
aS"Always freeze up at first. Or if you don't, you try to grab my arm. But the same way every time, right? So that makes it simple to break your wrist."
p1680
aS'When you double over whining, it\'s easy to grab your skull and smash it into the ground until you stop moving."'
p1681
aS'He knelt down, turning his head sideways to study my face, as if curious about the effect his words were having on me. "This time\'s different, though. _You\'re_ not lost yet. _You_ know the way back."'
p1682
aS'He reached out and tousled my hair, playful-rough. "And you\'re going to take me there, Orion. Take me back up. Or you\'re going to die."'
p1683
aS'He stood up again. "But this fucking key. Complicates things. You said you\'re on the wrong side, from your perspective. Yeah?" I didn\'t answer; he went on as if I had. "That means there\'s another you who\'s also found a key.'
p1684
aS'The twin key to this one, on the twin side. And if that other you didn\'t get ambushed by his old bestie"---a wicked grin---"he\'ll pop through to this side soon enough. Because.'
p1685
aS'You find a key, you\'re almost certainly only a few hours away from finding its door."'
p1686
aS'I couldn\'t see how this changed things. "Why does that m-matter?"'
p1687
aS'He turned the key over and over in his hand, staring at it. "Staying in sync. Wasn\'t that always our theory? I think we have to. Buddy. I told a lie earlier. I don\'t always kill you both right away. Sometimes I... ask questions."'
p1688
aS'He scraped a thumbnail along the key. "Find out where you\'ve been. What happened before. The ones who have it worst are always the ones who got too out of sync. With their doubles.'
p1689
aS'There\'s lots of connection points but the higher-up they are, the easier to get---misaligned. Two lasers pointing at each other, yeah? Nudge them just a bit, and instead of meeting, the beams go on forever."'
p1690
aS'I thought of the tunnel with the infinite fridge, and shuddered. "And if two sides lose sync entirely... if things warp too out of true..."'
p1691
aS'He made a sucking sound through his teeth, bringing it to a crescendo and then cutting it off, like a tire popping in reverse.'
p1692
aS'He glanced at me, then back to the key. "That\'s what happened to me. My double and I, we... diverged. And something tore. Or popped, maybe. Forget lasers. Think pairs of soap bubbles, floating in infinite void.'
p1693
aS"They need each other to stay stable. Our universes got too far apart and it wasn't good for them. They're gone now, or too far to ever reach. Dark."
p1694
aS'"But yours..." He grinned even more broadly. "A ripe pair. Undamaged. Still connected. To each other, and to you. You. I can follow you back into them like a thread. Like a fucking thread, Orion. Up and out and back and into the light."'
p1695
aS"This is the part where if I was a spy or an action hero, I'd be secretly digging a knife out of my pocket, working my way free of the bonds, taking advantage of the villain's distracted ranting to try for my freedom. But I wasn't a spy."
p1696
aS"I was a Bio major. I'd never been in a fight. I was trussed up, I couldn't move, the pain was still excruciating, and I had no idea what to do."
p1697
aS'As if to reinforce my stupid squandered opportunity, Niko seemed to notice me again. Abruptly he put the key in his pocket (his front right pocket, I noticed, desperate not to be completely helpless) and dug through my pack.'
p1698
aS'With a satisfied grunt, he pulled out rope, and proceeded to tie my hands and lower arms behind my back, so tight my elbows almost touched.'
p1699
aS'My freedom was slipping away. I tried to keep him talking. "But..." I had to clear my throat, heavy. "If my Niko\'s dead, isn\'t it too late? How can anything be in sync now?"'
p1700
aS'He paid no attention to this, continuing his rope work.'
p1701
aS"When he'd finished he wrapped the end a few times around my neck and fear spiked through me, but then he grabbed under my arms and lifted me gently to a sitting position, leaning against the wall."
p1702
aS'He went to the pack and pulled out my flashlight, shaking it. "This thing work?" I didn\'t answer: he was already toggling the switch on and off with no effect.'
p1703
aS'He grunted, dug some batteries from his own pack and slipped them in, nodding in satisfaction as the light came on. Pocketing it, he rummaged through my pack, eyes lighting up when he found my cache of food.'
p1704
aS'He ripped open the wrapper on a power bar and took a huge bite, grunting in satisfaction.'
p1705
aS'"Niko," I said, trying not to cry. "Please let me go."'
p1706
aS"He grimaced, like what I'd said had hurt him, and scooted closer to me, still chewing. He ran his fingers gently through my hair, tugged back my head. Stared into my eyes with a frown. Like he'd lost something in them."
p1707
aS'"I told another lie earlier, bud," he said, swallowing. "Sometimes those houses down there do have power, like I said. Who knows why or where it comes from, but sometimes they do."'
p1708
aS'I kept my eyes on his, hoping to find some empathy or humanity there.'
p1709
aS'He took another bite. Chewed more slowly this time.\n\nThere was nothing in his eyes.'
p1710
aS'"Power," he said, mouth half-full, "cold fridges. Sometimes. But nothing inside. They\'re empty. All of them. There\'s no food down there, Orion. None at all."'
p1711
aS"I couldn't stop trembling. I couldn't look away from his eyes."
p1712
aS'He swallowed again, shoved the last of the bar into his mouth. "But you and me," he said, mouth full, "other versions. Man, there\'s _so many_ of us. Popping up out of those houses, those millions of houses. Lost. Always lost. Pathetic.'
p1713
aS'Eaten all their food. Starving, out of their minds. They\'re already dead, really. Or a nudge away."'
p1714
aS'He swallowed the last of the power bar, licked his lips and the crumbs off his fingers. Then he leaned forward, slow, like he was going in for a kiss.\n\nHe stopped, face inches from mine.'
p1715
aS'"Wouldn\'t it be such a waste?" His breath smelled of processed figs. "Such a shame for all those deaths to have been for nothing. To have served no purpose. Don\'t you think?"\n\n"Niko," I begged, wanting it to mean so many things.'
p1716
aS'His finger touched my lips. "I think you get it. So. We have to find the door this key connects to. We have to wait for your doubles to come through---yours, and your dead friend\'s. Swap places with them. Pass back to your side.'
p1717
aS'Keep things _synchronous_. And then head up, up, up into the shallows, back to the surface, away from this place forever, and synchronicity can go fuck itself." He stood up, reaching down, and grabbed my shirt to jerk me to my feet.'
p1718
aS'He wrapped the end of the rope around his arm.'
p1719
aS'"But we\'d better get moving. Cause your door\'s going to be farther down from here. And best for both of us if we find it before I get too fucking hungry." He gestured back toward the way out of the jumbled maze of shelves, mockingly polite.'
p1720
aS'"After you, amigo."'
p1721
aS'Chapter 13\n\nWe kept moving, but nothing else was the same. I led, Niko following behind holding the rope wound around my neck.'
p1722
aS'He\'d cut the duct tape from my ankles so I could walk, but tied a blindfold made from a damp shirt tight around my face. "Little handicap," he said, "case you decide to wander off." I cringed when he clapped me playfully on the back.'
p1723
aS'"Don\'t worry, bud. If you\'re good, I\'ll tell you when you\'re about to walk into a pit."'
p1724
aS"Like a bitter parody of the exploring I'd done with my Niko, a million years ago, we searched. At intersections he'd describe each hallway, and casually discuss which way to go, as if we were equals."
p1725
aS"As if he hadn't threatened to kill me and worse. Other than a preference for moving toward anything weird or different, he seemed content to let me choose the direction."
p1726
aS'He marked the wall, tracing our path with fastidious care---"If we\'re doing it on this side, they\'re doing it on theirs, too"---and on the whole seemed downright cheerful.'
p1727
aS"For a while he whistled something I finally placed as the theme to one of our favorite shows. Just the second bar, over and over again.\n\nLike he'd forgotten the rest."
p1728
aS'I made little plans for how to get away.\n\nNone of them seemed very plausible.'
p1729
aS'From his descriptions, I gathered we were passing through a maze of identical drab halls.'
p1730
aS'The carpet underfoot was sometimes dry, sometimes thick with something that felt like dead mulch and made me stumble, and often slick with slime and mold.'
p1731
aS"We must have been only just above the water table, if such a concept made sense down here. Probably it didn't. Sometimes we'd go up dry stairs to a soaked hall at the top, or along a downward slant that went from squelchy to dusty."
p1732
aS'We were near water, anyway, moving through histories of past inundation. Niko described walls streaked with damage from it, paint browned and peeling. Once he found some mushrooms growing from a split baseboard, and stopped to eat them.'
p1733
aS'I could hear him chewing, a slimy sound. The smell as they mixed with his saliva was of pond scum and rotting dirt. He offered me one, but I declined, and he seemed unsurprised.'
p1734
aS"He said they'd keep you alive but weren't especially satisfying. I tried not to hear menace in that."
p1735
aS"There were few side rooms here, but he'd open the door to each we passed and check it. Bedroom-sized, he told me, all empty except for a small drain in the center of each floor."
p1736
aS'It was hard to keep my balance, blindfolded and with arms bound behind me, and I stumbled a lot. The adrenaline from earlier had worn off, leaving behind a dozen throbbing aches and a deep exhaustion. How long had I been down here?'
p1737
aS"I couldn't come up with a number, but my body knew the answer. Too long."
p1738
aS"At the next intersection I tripped on a rough patch of carpet and collapsed, smacking my chin against the ground. It hurt, and I started crying. Sobbing, actually. I'd never felt more useless, pathetic."
p1739
aS'Niko told me to shut up, and I tried to pull myself together. He sighed, and suggested we take a rest. Sniffling, I agreed.'
p1740
aS'He sat me up against a wall. I clenched and unclenched my tingling hands; from the elbows down everything was numb. After a while the tears stopped.'
p1741
aS"I wanted to sleep but couldn't bear waking back up to this. I wanted him to untie me, unwind the rope from my neck, let me go. I wanted to get away from him, or better yet for none of this to ever have happened at all."
p1742
aS'I wanted to be dreaming of something other than hallways, and him.'
p1743
aS"I could have none of these things. But he hadn't gagged me. I could still talk. And maybe talking together, like we'd done so much, I could find a way to reach him.\n\nSo I asked him about the things he'd seen, and he told me."
p1744
aS"He spoke of a hallway twelve miles long without a single door or turn. Of a huge labyrinth of circular halls he'd mapped, pressing towards the center, until at last he'd arrived triumphant in the small circular room at its core."
p1745
aS'All that was there was a muddy speaker from an old stereo, half-embedded in dirt floor.'
p1746
aS'He spoke of corridors whose floors and ceilings began to steepen in either direction, rising up to the vertical, gigantic carpeted wheels serving no rational purpose.'
p1747
aS"He spoke of more connection points between paired dimensions, useless to him since he couldn't find his way to the surface of any---and all _tangled_ down there, he said again. The connections always had some kind of airtight seal."
p1748
aS'Steam-filled wood saunas with a door at each end; school lockers just big enough to stand in with doors on each end;'
p1749
aS'a shower, but vertically stretched, thirty feet of bathroom tile with frosted glass doors at the top and bottom, and climbing its steel fixtures, faucets and knobs sticking out at random from the walls, climbing it all the way to the top.'
p1750
aS'Sometimes there were furnished rooms, he said, that you could almost imagine were part of a regular house.'
p1751
aS'Out the door you could pretend there was a kitchen, maybe, with bacon frying and morning light slanting through the window, or a porch with a cool breeze. As long as you stayed put it was almost like being home.'
p1752
aS'He said these rooms, by far, were the most dangerous of all.'
p1753
aS'He spoke of curving tunnels made from scraps of sandpaper and carpet samples, of flooded libraries swimming with illegible books, of a maze of closet the size of a city block, endless cramped turns ducking under dusty coat hangers.'
p1754
aS'He spoke of vast caves made entirely of stairs: walls, floor and ceiling expanding and contracting in carpeted, ninety-degree edges.'
p1755
aS"More than a decade later, the first time I saw a blocky cavern descending into shadow in _Minecraft_, I had to shut the game down, right then, turn on the lights, walk away. It looked exactly how I'd imagined Niko's stair-edged pits."
p1756
aS'Finally, he trailed off, and we steeped together for a while in the thick, unbroken quiet. I was trying to think what I could say to keep him talking, but he broke the silence first.'
p1757
aS'"You would have gone wild for some of that shit, man. Wish you could have been there." His voice was wistful. "All our crazy, stupid theories. We were wrong about everything. But it was more fun being wrong together."'
p1758
aS'I licked my lips. Maybe this was my chance.'
p1759
aS'"Yeah. Hell yeah," I started. "Jesus, man, I can\'t imagine what it\'s been like for you." _Isn\'t the phrase "I can only imagine?"_ some part of my brain whispered. I shook it off. "I mean, I don\'t know what I\'d have done, if it were me.'
p1760
aS'Alone down here." I took a breath, extemporizing. "You\'ve... done things to survive, and I mean who could blame you? Who\'s to say when push comes to shove what\'s right or wrong when survival\'s at stake?"'
p1761
aS"He didn't make a sound, and I couldn't see his face through the blindfold. But I sensed a tide shifting. I'd said something wrong. My chance was slipping away."
p1762
aS'"_You don\'t have to do this to me._" I hadn\'t meant to say it and not with such pitiful desperation, but now I couldn\'t help myself, couldn\'t stop babbling. "We\'re friends. You\'re my friend. We\'re only going to survive by working together.'
p1763
aS'You don\'t have to keep me tied up like this. I want the same thing you want. To get out, get the fuck out of here---"\n\n"Friends." he interrupted, voice dangerously quiet. "Is that what we were? Back in the day?"'
p1764
aS'My chest was tight. "Yeah. I thought so. Weren\'t we?"'
p1765
aS"I heard a scratching sound. A dog itching itself. I couldn't see but had a clear image: he was scratching the hair behind his ear, head tilted, half-turned down."
p1766
aS"Something he always did right before explaining something he didn't think he should have to explain."
p1767
aS'"I\'ve had a lot of time to think, Ry." His voice was still calm. "About our _friendship_. About _us_." I jerked: he\'d rested his fist on the top of my shoe. "Why we ended up down here."'
p1768
aS'I was losing him, or had already lost him, but I didn\'t know how or why or what I could say to reverse it. "Yeah?"'
p1769
aS'"Yeah," he said, lifting the fist and letting it fall back on my sneaker. "I think maybe there was more going on than I really appreciated at the time. For. Example." He punctuated each word with a harder bap on my foot.'
p1770
aS'"We only found this place because of you. Remember? Because you found it, underneath your bed."'
p1771
aS'"Okay," I said, "but---"\n\nHe shushed me, and I sensed him stiffen, twist his head away. He switched on the flashlight and dim light filtered through the blindfold. He seemed to be pointing it down the hallway, back the way we had come.'
p1772
aS'"What is it?"'
p1773
aS'"Shut up. Did you hear anything?"'
p1774
aS'I shook my head, distant relief mingling with fresher fear. "No."'
p1775
aS'Silence. It seemed to expand in my head, like those disposable earplugs, eating up all the empty space.'
p1776
aS'Finally he turned back toward me. "I think something\'s following us."'
p1777
aS'Some_thing_. Not someone. Oh. "Like what?"'
p1778
aS'"You know about the other versions of us down here." He snickered. "More than you\'d like to. The doubles, and their doubles from the other houses, and so on. They\'re us, more or less exactly.'
p1779
aS'Which is why we get that sick feeling when they\'re close. And because they\'re us exactly, it makes them easy to take out. Don\'t have to learn their weaknesses, because fuck, you already know them." He paused for a moment.'
p1780
aS'"But there\'s... other ones."'
p1781
aS'I wasn\'t sure I wanted to prod, but found myself doing it anyway. "Other ones?"'
p1782
aS'He shook his head. "Ever see someone watching you down here? Like at the edge of your light?"'
p1783
aS'"No," I said, hair rising. "I mean... I don\'t think so."'
p1784
aS'"If you get closer, you can see they look like us, too. Always a Niko or an Orion. On the outside, anyway." The pattern of light shifted as he swung it down each of the other hallways, then back to the first again.'
p1785
aS'"When you get close to a double of yourself, you can feel it. Right? Feels wrong, somehow. Bad. Something to do with the synchronicity, I think, the risk.'
p1786
aS"If the two of you see each other get out of sync, if you understand you've broken it... bad news, and your body senses it. That danger."
p1787
aS'"But. These other things. You get close to one of them, even if it looks like you, you don\'t feel anything at all. And that somehow makes it so much worse." He spat. "Because it means the Sham-Friends aren\'t human.'
p1788
aS'They look like us, but they\'re not, not really. They\'re something else."'
p1789
aS'"You named them the fucking Sham-Friends?" I was horrified. "Thanks. Not creepy at all."'
p1790
aS'He laughed a genuine laugh, then cut it short, like he was upset with himself. Like I was pulling something over on him. "They _are_ creepy, dumbshit. They just stand there.'
p1791
aS'They don\'t usually come too close, but if you walk up to them, they don\'t move away. They don\'t move at all. They watch you." He sniffed. "I mean they move their eyes, you know. To track you. Their heads. They breathe."'
p1792
aS'He unscrewed the water bottle and took a swig. "But they don\'t respond to anything you do. _Anything._"'
p1793
aS'He paused, as if to let that sink in. Or as if remembering something.'
p1794
aS'"And if you walk off," he continued, "they\'ll follow you. At a distance. But if you stay in one place for too long, sometimes. Sometimes. They kind of creep up on you. Slow. Edge a tiny bit forward every now and then.'
p1795
aS'Like they\'re eager, but also real, real patient. I woke up one time and two of them, two Nikos, were bent over me. Standing there for fuck knows how long while I slept. Staring. Mona Lisa smiles."'
p1796
aS'He shrugged. "If you sprint for a while, take some twists and turns, you can shake them. Creepy, yeah, but not a problem."'
p1797
aS'_Oh well that\'s fine then._ "What are they?"'
p1798
aS'"No idea." He laughed that hollow bark-laugh again. "Maybe echoes, or waves, or something. Waves and particles. Superimpositions. This whole place, Downstairs, it\'s like some kind of huge multiplier. You\'ve figured that out, right?'
p1799
aS'At least that much? It multiplies. Dimensions, people. Rooms. Ideas. Emotions. Some kind of chain reaction that got started somehow, sometime.'
p1800
aS'There\'s a spring down here," and he was almost chanting now, murmuring, his voice gone strange, "clear waters at the source. Deep. All the water comes from there. Very, very deep.'
p1801
aS'It splits, and splits, and splits again, and keeps splitting. Thousands of times. Millions.'
p1802
aS'And each stream is as big as the one it\'s splitting from, and they shouldn\'t all fit but they do, and it\'s wrong, it can\'t fit in your head, it\'s too big _it\'s too big..._"\n\nHe seemed to catch himself, stiffened.'
p1803
aS'"But the Sham-Friends," he said, in control again. "They do it too, sometimes. There\'ll be two of them, moving almost in sync. Or four. I think if two bump into each other, they sort of stick together, cluster up.'
p1804
aS'And if those two meet others, they all join up, like a fucking molecule. Snarled in bigger and bigger tangles." He was watching me now, I guessed; I got the sense he was smirking, enjoying the effect the story was having on me.'
p1805
aS'I turned my head nervously in the direction of the hallway I couldn\'t see. "And you think there\'s one back there now?"'
p1806
aS'"Oh, I know there is," he said. "It\'s standing right there, watching you."'
p1807
aS'I jolted back, lost my balance, and topped over, kicking back with my feet and scrambling to right myself.'
p1808
aS"My skin was crawling and all I wanted was to get farther away, except I couldn't see it, couldn't see anything,"
p1809
aS'and _what if a second one is coming up behind me---_\n\nBut Niko was laughing now, and it slowly dawned on me through my terror what that probably meant.'
p1810
aS'"You fucking pussy." He climbed to his feet, grunting. "Dumb of me. If you\'d wet your pants I\'d have to smell it the rest of the way."'
p1811
aS'I awkwardly struggled upright, stood, furious. He made no move to help.'
p1812
aS"But I knew him too well. He might have been bluffing at the end, but only to cover for being legitimately scared. He _had_ heard something down the hall, or thought he had. And he hadn't been teasing when he'd started talking."
p1813
aS'At least some of that had been true.'
p1814
aS'He tugged on the rope around my neck. "Storytime\'s over, bitch. Get moving."'
p1815
aS"* * *\n\nWalking blind into the unknown isn't fun, and gets worse when you're freshly terrified of it. I kept expecting now to walk into a body, someone standing in my way, fleshy and warm and inhuman. Staring. But I didn't."
p1816
aS"To my captor's credit, he never let me walk into a wall (or a pit), although he was sometimes rough with jerks to the rope around my neck to correct me."
p1817
aS"But I was reaching the limits of my endurance. My collapse by the nightlight felt like eons ago, and maybe I'd only slept for an hour or two there, anyway."
p1818
aS'Waves of emotion had washed through me since then, each one leaving its own high-water mark. I stumbled even over level ground. I was barely awake.'
p1819
aS'Niko finally noticed, and agreed we could stop for "a sleep." He let me lie down, but kept my head covered and hands tied. It was better than nothing.'
p1820
aS"It's a testament to the depth of my exhaustion that I fell asleep within moments. This time, I didn't dream."
p1821
aS'I blinked awake some time later, not quite sure what had woken me. Niko breathed quietly, a few feet away. I got the sense he was sitting up against the wall, legs folded up, and I was lying at his feet in the center of the hall.'
p1822
aS"It was dark. He must have turned the flashlight off, not that I'd be able to see much anyway with a t-shirt tied around my face."
p1823
aS'I wondered if I could, very slowly and quietly, wriggle away. Like a worm out of a tackle box.'
p1824
aS'He reached out and nudged me with his foot. "Don\'t even think about it, bitch." But the nudge was gentle, and his voice tired.\n\nWe stayed there for a long moment, listening to each other breathe.'
p1825
aS'Finally, he exhaled, loud, frustrated. "You think I want this?" He sounded desperate. Near tears. "I don\'t. Any of it. Scaring you like this. I\'m not a monster, man, I don\'t get off on it. I\'m doing what I have to.'
p1826
aS'You don\'t get that, I know, but you haven\'t been down here long enough. Nowhere near long enough."\n\nI stayed quiet, afraid to say something that might make him angry again.'
p1827
aS'He sighed. "I don\'t always kill you, either. Or at least not right away. Sometimes, first. For old times\' sake, you know. I fuck you."\n\nThe word _fuck_ stung me.'
p1828
aS'He leaned forward, holding his head a foot above mine. His breath tickled the fabric at my ear. "You do remember, don\'t you? The time we did it?" He sounded concerned. "That night, after I tried to kill myself?"'
p1829
aS"Sometimes when a person is stung their body overreacts. They swell up, maybe so much their eyes are forced shut. It's called anaphylaxis. Unprotected, in the Greek. But the point is it's not the sting that's doing it to you, not really."
p1830
aS'It\'s your own body, blinding you and destroying itself in a misguided attempt to keep you safe.\n\n"Yes," I whispered.'
p1831
aS'"That was maybe the closest I ever felt to anyone." His voice was calm, bland, like recounting a decent lunch he\'d had. "I loved you so much. Not in that way, you know. Not the way you wanted me to. But I figured what the fuck.'
p1832
aS'You saved me. No, not just that." His finger brushed my cheek through the fabric and I flinched. "You _needed_ me. I was _everything_ to you. That felt so fucking good."'
p1833
aS"I was trying to stay motionless. I remembered a safety video they'd made us watch at Yellowstone. _If you're on the ground and a bear attacks you, curl into a ball and play dead. Don't fight back. The bear will win._"
p1834
aS"I couldn't open my eyes, couldn't breathe. Maybe it was the anaphylaxis. Something somewhere was terrifying. Doppelgangers lurking in basement hallways. A camper in a tent, terrified by his own snores.\n\n_The bear will win._"
p1835
aS'His hand moved over the shirt wrapped around my head, not quite touching it, not quite pulling away. "I want to get that feeling back sometimes, you know? It\'s so fucking lonely here. You can\'t blame me."'
p1836
aS'He laughed, so loud and close to my face I cringed. "I mean. Don\'t get me wrong. I\'d prefer a girl but there aren\'t any down here. Just us. Only us."'
p1837
aS'His fingers outlined my face. "Anyway. Doesn\'t work. Never works. Never the same with you." He breathed out through his nostrils and it tickled the fabric by my cheek. "I can\'t trust you. Any of these versions of you. Ry, Ryan, Orion.'
p1838
aS"You seem different but you're all the same. Everything you ever said or did after that. Was bullshit. None of you gave a shit about me, did you? What I needed. Who I was. You just wanted it to happen again."
p1839
aS'"And the next time I tried to off myself, that\'s the only reason you stopped me, isn\'t it?" He rapped his knuckles on my forehead, through the shirt. "Isn\'t it, bitch."'
p1840
aS'"No." It was so soft, I\'m not even sure he heard me.'
p1841
aS'I could feel him shrug. "Anyway, that\'s why I kill you, after. Case you were wondering."'
p1842
aS'He sat back up, wincing. "But sorry, man, not tonight. Got a headache." He stood, kicked me in the side. "Come on. Better keep moving. We\'re close. I can feel it."'
p1843
aS'Chapter 14\n\nSoon the texture of the ground beneath my feet started to vary in frequent, abrupt transitions. First it went glossy-smooth, then to shag, then to changing patterns and textures of creaking wood, tile, and carpet.'
p1844
aS'I stumbled more and more over bumps and irregularities, as if the floor was crumpling, bunching up as we neared some pressure point.'
p1845
aS'Niko opened every door we passed now. At the third one after we slowed down, he sucked in a sharp breath.'
p1846
aS'"Definitely on the right track. You\'re gonna need eyes for this, kiddo." He pulled my blindfold free.'
p1847
aS'I blinked in the sudden glare from his light. He stood between me and the open doorway at the end of the hall. It was dark inside and cold damp air spilled out; I could see something glittering in the gloom behind him. Ice?'
p1848
aS'"Take a look," he said with a grin. "I\'ll shine the light. But don\'t lean too far in. I wouldn\'t bet your life on my grip on the rope."'
p1849
aS"Wondering what he meant, I shuffled to the doorframe. He turned and shined the light past me, and that's when the vertigo hit."
p1850
aS"The door opened onto a drop-off. The opposite wall was distant but visible at the edge of our light, so couldn't have been more than a hundred feet away. But the floor and ceiling were gone."
p1851
aS'Past the doorframe, the wall plunged up and down into limitless blackness. Turning my head carefully to the left and right, I could see the walls also extended into dim infinity in either direction.'
p1852
aS'We were peeking out the side of a canyon that seemed to stretch on forever: up, down, left, and right.'
p1853
aS'The walls were pink and pillowy. For a queasy moment they looked like skin, until I realized what they actually were. Fiberglass.'
p1854
aS'The endless walls stretching into the gloom were pink insulation foam, divided by rectangular grids of dusty wood, marked here and there with pencil marks and marred by chipped, discolored edges.'
p1855
aS"We were termites in the walls of a giant's house."
p1856
aS'Here and there, other open doorways interrupted the endless pink sea of insulation. Streams of water spilled from some, cascading down into an inky depth that gave back no hint of answering splash. Cascades plunged down from above us, too.'
p1857
aS'The space was filled with a cold and heavy mist.'
p1858
aS"Curving down from the base of the doorway was a filigreed structure I couldn't at first identify. My impression of ice was wrong: it was laid out more like a spiderweb, a grid of sparkly intersecting lines."
p1859
aS'As I squinted I realized the sparkles were countless tiny crystals, dangling from some kind of mesh and reflecting back the flashlight in hundreds of shimmering glints.'
p1860
aS'As the web curved down and away it grew denser and denser, strands converging towards a point maybe sixty feet below and another sixty away from the door.'
p1861
aS'The lines of dangling crystal converged there into an dense, scintillating object a couple feet across.'
p1862
aS'A chandelier. I blinked. It hung with no obvious point of support above a long narrow platform covered in junk.'
p1863
aS'It was as if the chandelier had exploded, but only in one direction,'
p1864
aS'toward us: crystals multiplying and propagating outward and upward in an ever-widening wave of fractal repetition, connecting the chandelier to our hallway with a web of glass.'
p1865
aS'"It\'s a Confusion," Niko said with a satisfied grin. "Means we\'re real close now."'
p1866
aS'"A what?" I backed away from the horrifying drop-off.'
p1867
aS'"What I call them." He shrugged. "Most of Downstairs tends to follow normal architectural rules. Walls, floor, ceiling, measurements more or less what you\'d expect. Bedroom objects in bedrooms."'
p1868
aS'He played his light along the chandelier-net, watching its cut-glass facets sparkle. "But close to a connection point, things get jumbled up. Perspectives change. Architecture gets stretched to breaking.'
p1869
aS'Like it\'s harder to maintain the semblance of order, for some reason."\n\nI thought of our fridge, in a kitchen with a pool that had a door at the bottom.'
p1870
aS'"This one," he added, frowning down, "is pretty fucking weird, though."'
p1871
aS'Still struggling with vertigo (tipping forward, arms bound, unable to stop myself as I crashed through the flimsy web and tumbled down that bottomless canyon) I followed his gaze.'
p1872
aS"The lines of chandelier-stuff converged above what I'd at first seen as a narrow strip of ground some way below and in front of us, itself suspended over that awful drop."
p1873
aS"But as I focused on the strip of ground, I realized it wasn't a flat surface, but something more complex: a sort of huge tube or pipe, maybe thirty feet thick, stretching away in both directions."
p1874
aS"It ran straight as an arrow, like some immense piece of plumbing running through the wall. You could walk flat along the top of the pipe's back in either direction, assuming you could get down there in the first place."
p1875
aS'Its endpoints, if any, were lost in darkness.\n\nAnd it got weirder.'
p1876
aS'The tube appeared to be made of the same scuffed, dusty hardwood floor tiles as my bedroom. A profusion of tatty throw rugs clung flat to its surface even on the curving sides, like stickers on a tipped-over water bottle.'
p1877
aS'And a motley collection of bedroom furniture was scattered all around it, also attached in some gravity-defying way to the curved surface. No matter the angle, the furniture rose from the hardwood tube as if down was towards its center.'
p1878
aS'A dresser canted at a forty-five degree angle; the top of a bookshelf poked up around the edge of the curve, like peering over the horizon of a tiny planet.'
p1879
aS'So yeah, picture looking down at an immense pipe that had somehow coated itself in superglue and mugged a secondhand furniture store,'
p1880
aS'encrusting itself with beds, nightstands, dressers, floor lamps (some lit), bookshelves, bureaus, trashcans, and laundry hampers.'
p1881
aS'Escher\'s own frat house. And all suspended over a drop-off to god knows where, surrounded by endless walls of pink insulation foam, connected to us via exploded rays of chandelier.\n\n"Holy shit," I said.'
p1882
aS'He laughed. "Damn straight. Okay then. Who wants to go first?"'
p1883
aS"* * *\n\nIt was me. Surprise. Niko realized he'd have to untie my hands for me to climb down, and if he went first, there'd be nothing to stop me running off back the way we'd come."
p1884
aS"I'd be running in the wrong direction, away from the supposed portal back to my own side, but I felt like that might be preferable to being the prisoner of a hungry psychopath who looked like a strung-out version of my dead best friend."
p1885
aS"Of course, if I went first there'd be nothing to stop me running off along the impossible bedroom-tube, either. Except I'd have exactly two directions to choose from and Niko would have a birds-eye view on which one I picked."
p1886
aS'Academic, anyway: he retied the rope around my ankle, let out enough slack for me to get down, and wound the other end around the doorknob of the last room back, a few paces up the hall.'
p1887
aS'"This probably won\'t hold your weight," he added, tugging the rope experimentally. "Not for long anyway. But if I brace myself and take some of the load, it should be enough."'
p1888
aS'He explained the plan while sliding fresh batteries into a headlamp and tightening it onto my head: I would climb down the chandelier net while he and the doorknob stood ready to catch me if I fell.'
p1889
aS"When I got to the top of the tube-path, he'd retie the rope to himself, and follow me down while I braced from below. He reminded me that since we'd be tied together, catching him if he fell would be in our mutual interest."
p1890
aS"He also mentioned, quite casually, that he had no plans to kill me. Our deal held. Once I got him to the surface, he'd vanish and I'd never see him again."
p1891
aS"If I messed with him, though---tried to untie my rope while down there and run off, or got funny ideas about yanking it---he would hunt me down. He told me of his expertise at hunting me down---me, personally. He'd done it dozens of times."
p1892
aS"He'd know which way I'd choose at intersections. Where I'd try to hide."
p1893
aS"And once he found me, he'd hurt me. He'd spend a long time hurting me.\n\nHe was an expert at that too, he said."
p1894
aS"As if to illustrate this point he pulled out a camping knife with a long, serrated blade and flipped it open: the kind you'd use to saw through small deadwood to make tinder."
p1895
aS"We'd looked at one just like it at the sporting goods store, my Niko and I, but decided not to get it. After admiring it for a moment, he closed it and attached it to his belt."
p1896
aS'I wondered if this was less a threat than insurance against being tied together above a gut-clenching drop. Maybe some of each.\n\nHe watched me watching the knife, with cut-glass intensity.'
p1897
aS'"Time to go," he said.'
p1898
aS'I clutched the doorjamb, trying not to stare down at the bottomless canyon past the edge of the carpet. Trying to think of some way to get out of this.'
p1899
aS'"What do you think\'s down there?" I asked, buying time.'
p1900
aS'He didn\'t look up, focused on a knot. "Water," he said. "Everything ends in water down here. Or maybe we\'re above the City. With all the houses, like I told you. Sometimes there\'s smashed-up stuff down there.'
p1901
aS'Ruined furniture, shattered light bulbs with tangled-up cords. Maybe this is where it comes from."'
p1902
aS'He pulled the cinch tight. "Rules of geometry don\'t really make sense this deep, though. Maybe we\'re already below the City. Maybe this goes down forever."'
p1903
aS'He got to his feet, wincing and putting a hand momentarily to his temples. "Okay, quit stalling. Get moving."'
p1904
aS'"Hang on." Fear sweated out of me. "We don\'t even know if this mesh or net or whatever will hold my weight. Or if this portal you\'re looking for is even down there."'
p1905
aS'"It\'s down there." He set his grip on the rope. "I\'m sure of that. But as for your first concern..."\n\nHe shrugged, then shoved me, hard.'
p1906
aS'I flailed, but my body was already past the edge of the door, my hands too slow to grab the frame, world tilting at a sickening angle.'
p1907
aS'My sneaker tried to glue itself to the carpet of the hall but my center of mass was too far out, way too far. My head dropped below my feet and I opened my mouth to scream as I began to fall into nothingness.'
p1908
aS'* * *\n\nWith a tinkling smash, I crashed into the net of chandelier. It was like landing on an uncomfortably studded trampoline, sloped sharply down.'
p1909
aS'For a second everything swayed, nauseating, and I scrambled for a grip, but I was slipping, sliding over the scraping glass baubles, down and sideways towards the edge...'
p1910
aS'With a whimper I clutched the mesh beneath me, wrapping my hands around faceted glass and wire and jamming my feet into gaps. One leg was dangling out into the yawning void of empty space, but my other three limbs were all caught.'
p1911
aS'I jerked to a stop, gasping, swaying, heart pounding so hard I could barely think, spread-eagled like a fly in a tacky, glittering web.'
p1912
aS'From somewhere above, Niko laughed. "See!" he called down. "Speculate, theorize all you want. Only way to get answers is to dive in head first. Or butt first, in your case." He let out some slack in the rope.'
p1913
aS'"Now untwist your panties and get climbing."'
p1914
aS'I wriggled away from the unthinkable drop-off, back toward the center of the jangling net. Moving was awkward: the mesh was a grid of thin metal wire, squares maybe eight or nine inches apart up here, but denser farther down.'
p1915
aS'Little glass baubles dangled from it every few inches, sparkling in the beam of my headlamp. The thing was not comfortable to crawl on, and had enough give that it deformed alarmingly as I shifted my weight.'
p1916
aS"The thin mesh cut into my hands unless I was careful; I'd scraped them both, stopping myself from falling."
p1917
aS"I looked back up. The hall we'd arrived from was one of a handful interrupting the expanse of smooth pink insulation, but water poured from each of the others, and there was no obvious way to reach any of them."
p1918
aS"Shuddering, I looked down along the path of books, scouting my route to the relative safety of the impossible bedroom's curving surface. The steep slope of the net up here flattened as it dropped and converged to chandelier."
p1919
aS"I decided facing the net and right-side up was the safest position to start, like climbing down a ladder. When the thing became more horizontal, I'd have to twist around and crawl, then drop the last few feet to the top of the tube."
p1920
aS'It was awkward and slow going, in part because I took significantly more care than I strictly needed. I did not want to trust my life to that murderous asshole and a fucking doorknob.'
p1921
aS"One handhold and foothold at a time (and ignoring Niko's frequent insults and urgings to hurry the fuck up) I finally made it to the chandelier proper, which I noticed, disconcertingly, wasn't connected to anything at all."
p1922
aS'Nevertheless, it was rock-solid, anchored with implacable tenacity to its chosen point in space, hovering above the top of the tube beneath, as if hanging from the ceiling of an ordinary room.'
p1923
aS'Carefully, I pushed my feet over the tinkling edge and dropped the few feet to the curving hardwood beneath me.'
p1924
aS'I landed hard and dropped into a crouch, adrenaline flaring. While nice to be off the chandelier net, this felt only slightly less precarious.'
p1925
aS'The very top of the huge tube was level enough, but the edges curved down on both sides with alarming speed.'
p1926
aS'The zone where I felt comfortable standing was a rounded summit only five or six feet wide; after that, the slope got steeper and steeper.'
p1927
aS"Looking down the length of the tube, the flat zone of safety stretched forward straight as a freeway, but in no way a clear one. To navigate it, you'd have to clamber over beds, edge vertiginously around angled desks."
p1928
aS'It was as if all the furniture was bolted to that cylindrical floor.'
p1929
aS'Turning toward the sickening curve of the drop-off and seeing the tops of bedroom junk poking up from beyond the horizon a few feet away,'
p1930
aS"I again couldn't shake the sense I was on a tiny planet furnished out of the IKEA catalogue and the dregs of garage sales, albeit one stretched from a sphere into an infinitely long cylinder."
p1931
aS'Experimentally, I took a few steps curveward, wondering if gravity somehow worked differently here; but it didn\'t seem to, at least not for me. The angle felt steep and dangerous. My own "down" was still toward the dark chasm underneath.'
p1932
aS'Whether the furniture really was bolted to the floor or just obeying its own special rules would have to remain a mystery.'
p1933
aS"I finally remembered Niko, who'd stopped berating me some time ago, and glanced up to see what he was doing. He wasn't there. I frowned."
p1934
aS'The rope tied to my ankle curved up to the lip of the hall, tracing the path of the chandelier-net, and vanished inside. I was so far below the hallway now I could only see a few feet of walls and ceiling through its open door.'
p1935
aS"The corridor still seemed lit by the refracted glow of a flashlight, moving around somewhere back there, so I figured he hadn't gone far. Maybe he was untying the rope from the doorknob and tying it to himself, so he could follow me down."
p1936
aS"But he'd been at it a while."
p1937
aS'_Shit._ This was an opportunity, and I was squandering it. I glanced down at the rope tied to my ankle, but there were multiple knots, some kind of Navy-ass shit, pulled so tight my foot was losing circulation. Sharp.'
p1938
aS"I needed something sharp. I cast around desperately. A few paces from me was a nightstand with drawers, and I yanked one open, hoping for---I don't know. Something. Anything."
p1939
aS'But there was only junk inside: a few dusty paperclips, a mechanical pencil with a missing eraser. A single red prize ticket from a skeeball alley.\n\nI stared at it, despair creeping over me.'
p1940
aS"Light played across my face. I started and looked up, guilty. Niko was back, peering down distractedly from the doorway, the rope now tied around his waist. He didn't seem to notice what I was doing. He seemed on edge."
p1941
aS'"I think there\'s one of those fucking Sham-Friends up here," he said. "Way, way back in the hall. At the edge of my light. Doesn\'t matter. Not going back that way, are we? I\'m coming down. Find something to brace yourself on.'
p1942
aS'Brace good and tight," he added, "because if I fall and you\'re not secure, you\'re coming with me, baby."\n\nMaybe that would be preferable, the best fate for all concerned.'
p1943
aS"But maybe he was telling the truth. Maybe he really wasn't planning to kill me. Maybe there was a door up ahead for my key. A way back.\n\n_Without Niko?_"
p1944
aS'My survival instinct shoved the thought away, like a drowner pushing their rescuer down into the choking depths, desperate to keep their own head above water.'
p1945
aS"I looked for a way to brace myself, and that's when I discovered the furniture _was_ bolted to the floor."
p1946
aS'Whether on the top of the curve or sticking horizontally out of its side, it was all attached with thick steel bolts at every contact point to the ground, even the plastic trash cans.'
p1947
aS'None of it budged an inch even when I put my whole back into trying to move it.'
p1948
aS'"Bracing shouldn\'t be a problem,"\nI shouted up, but there was no response.'
p1949
aS"I figured he hadn't heard---the forest of insulation around us swallowed up sound, creating a surreal distance to everything,"
p1950
aS'like someone had turned down the volume on reality---but when I looked up to shout, Niko was staring back down the hallway behind him again.'
p1951
aS'"I think it got closer." He glanced down at me for a moment, face unreadable, then looked back down the hall. "While I wasn\'t looking. Fucking creepy. In fact..." He trailed off, staring at something I couldn\'t see.'
p1952
aS'My vantage point only showed a couple feet of ceiling.'
p1953
aS'"What?" My stomach churned, as if in warning.\n\nHe didn\'t look away from whatever he was staring at.'
p1954
aS'"It\'s got something in its hand," he said, quite calmly.'
p1955
aS'Nausea swept through me, chemical fear. Hairs prickled all over my body.'
p1956
aS'"It\'s coming toward me, Ry." He was still calm, still staring down the hall. "I\'m starting down in twenty seconds. Tie the rope around something. Fast."'
p1957
aS"Maybe he was messing with me again. Trying to put the fear of god in me so I'd hurry it up."
p1958
aS"Or maybe he wasn't. I knew what his calm tone meant. What he hid behind it. He was fucking terrified."
p1959
aS'"I\'ve never seen one move like this," he said, voice still calm. "It\'s running down the hall towards me, now. Ryan. Hurry."'
p1960
aS'Something inside me screamed.'
p1961
aS"_He's not lying and something is coming and there's nowhere to run and maybe I should let it get him but I'm tied to him I'm fucking tied---"
p1962
aS'_\n\nI ripped my gaze from the hall and cast frantically around the narrow path of safety for something secure,'
p1963
aS'anything heavy.'
p1964
aS'There: a bulky bed with a bookcase headboard filled with books and knick-knacks. I scrambled underneath it, over on top of it, then scrambled underneath the bed and back over the top, pulling the rope tied to my ankle behind.'
p1965
aS'"Hurry up," he shouted from above, still staring down the hall, and then _I could hear it_. Footsteps, beating against the carpet. Something running down the hallway, running flat out. A manic run. Fast. As fast as it could.'
p1966
aS'"Ready," I shouted up, not sure which side to root for, not sure of anything but the pulse hammering in my ears.'
p1967
aS'He nodded once, then pulled his gaze away and swung out over the edge, flipping around to face the net, feet feeling for purchase while he clutched the end of the carpet.'
p1968
aS'Focusing on his hands, not glancing down the hall again, he started down. His descent was much quicker than mine, efficient and smooth. But still not fast enough.'
p1969
aS'It was coming for him. The footsteps thudded the hall above, creaked loose floorboards. They were close.'
p1970
aS'"Shit," he said. "Shit shit shit." He was still close to the doorway. Too close.\n\n_What is it what does it want why is it running what does it have in its..._'
p1971
aS'With shocking suddenness a hand wrapped itself around the doorframe. It gripped it tight as a body appeared behind it, skidding on the carpet, coming to a halt on the edge of the drop-off.'
p1972
aS"I shivered as I saw it, every part of me shocked into motion like I'd leapt into an ice-cold stream. I wanted to scream but couldn't. My gaze was fixed on the thing in the doorway.\n\nAnd then I recognized its face."
p1973
aS'It was Niko. Young again.\n\n_My Niko._'
p1974
aS'He raised his hand and shot his older clone with my gun.'
p1975
aS'But even as he did something _changed_ around us. The tube rippled beneath my feet, writhing, flexing.'
p1976
aS'The endless canyon of pink insulation around us groaned and stretched, pulled away, growing dimmer in the scattered light of our headlamps. New grid lines appeared as the wood reconfigured itself.\n\nDownstairs was growing larger.'
p1977
aS'I looked back up. The bullet had gone wide as both Nikos had grabbed for support in the sudden groaning sway.'
p1978
aS"But now younger Niko was lifting the gun again while Elder scrabbled for purchase on the jangling net (_and it can't be my gun_, I thought distantly, _no more bullets_) and younger Niko changed his aim, steadied himself;"
p1979
aS"but Elder snarled, leapt back up four feet of net in a frantic bound, and wrapped his arms around his double's lower legs, hanging his whole weight on them; and younger Niko's knees buckled and he tumbled forward onto the net with a cry."
p1980
aS"Or maybe it was me who cried out, I wasn't sure, and I couldn't breathe, because both Nikos were snarling, scrambling for purchase on each other, on the gun, on the precarious net beneath them as they tumbled down it."
p1981
aS'They were seconds away from slipping off the side, from plunging into the void of empty space beneath us.'
p1982
aS'"Look out!" I shrieked, but young Niko had jammed his gun hand through a gap in the net, jerking them both to a halt. The web of chandelier-stuff bucked and heaved, tinkling like a dump truck full of glass.'
p1983
aS'An eyebolt connecting it to the doorframe wrenched free with a splintering groan. I felt the same crawling horror of watching a spider fight a scrabbling insect, vicious, instinctual.'
p1984
aS'Elder Niko plunged his hand through also to the underside of the net, wrestling for the gun. It went off again with a muffled thump, swallowed up by the acres of insulation around us.'
p1985
aS'Something zipped past my face in the same instant and I ducked, belatedly, eyes still glued on the fight above.'
p1986
aS'Elder Niko lifted his other arm high and elbowed his double hard in the gut, but was met with a savage kick; he grunted and started sliding again, grasping at the beads of glass for purchase.'
p1987
aS'Young Niko struggled to pull his gun arm out of the net but all his weight was on it now and the wire frame dug into his skin.'
p1988
aS'Elder had grabbed his leg and was yanking on it; he kicked at the grasping hands, and as he did I remembered something vitally important.'
p1989
aS'"He\'s tied to me!" I screamed.'
p1990
aS'Elder laughed as Niko\'s eyes widened. "That\'s right, asshole," he shouted. "If I go, your boyfriend goes."'
p1991
aS'Niko bit his lip, recalculating, and pushed himself higher with a grunt, yanking his arm free. But as he did the gun caught on one of the glass baubles, and before he could grab it the weapon was sliding and scraping down the net.'
p1992
aS'Toward the other Niko, who lunged for it, laughing.'
p1993
aS"In a clear mental flash I saw what would happen: he'd grab it, he'd shoot young Niko between the eyes;"
p1994
aS"his face would go slack and he'd fall off the net into the void and vanish, and it wasn't that I loved him or couldn't survive without him but something else, a pure flash of righteous indignant anger rising up in me."
p1995
aS"After coming back for me, after _rescuing_ me, when he could and maybe should have left me behind, he didn't deserve to die like this."
p1996
aS'Elder was stretched out precariously, hand only inches from the gun, and without thinking or planning I grabbed the rope trailing up to him and yanked it, with all the strength I had.'
p1997
aS'He let out a _whoof_ as his torso lurched back, all the air forced out of him, and balanced for a heartbeat at a crazy angle, only one foot touching the jangling net. Then momentum pulled him backward, over the side, and he fell.'
p1998
aS'Everything happened very fast.\n\nThe gun slipped through a gap in the net and tumbled into darkness.'
p1999
aS"Elder screamed in fury and grabbed for the edge of the net. He caught it and the whole thing twisted; but he'd snagged only a single strand and it couldn't stop him."
p2000
aS'It shrugged him off, slicing the skin off his fingers, and he fell, arms and legs flailing, trailing rope behind him.'
p2001
aS"But his grab for the net had dislodged my Niko too, and he was head down and slipping, flailing, grasping, tangled up in Elder's rope."
p2002
aS"All this happened faster than movement. Maybe my brain had sent signals to my muscles, but they hadn't arrived yet, or my body was too confused to interpret them."
p2003
aS'Elder tumbled down, rope twisting behind him. He reached toward the cylinder, but it was too far away; he was going to fall past it.'
p2004
aS'He stretched for a piece of furniture instead and collided with it, face scraping against the top of a sideways bureau;'
p2005
aS'a spurt of blood exploded from his cheek even as he scrabbled to get a grip but he was moving too fast, and he kept falling.'
p2006
aS"Above me, my Niko cursed and slid off the edge of the net. The tangled rope had gone taut and yanked him off, and he was falling too. Only he wasn't tied onto a rope. He wasn't tied to anything."
p2007
aS"I finally moved, lurched forward to do something, anything. But Elder had fallen out of my sight line around the curve, and his end of the rope tied to the bed I stood on snapped taut with a creak, wrapping tight to the cylinder's curve."
p2008
aS'Young Niko plunged by on the edge of my vision, colliding with a piece of furniture and tumbling with it. Before I could think, before I could stop myself, I threw myself off the edge of the cylinder after him, arcing down into nothingness.'
p2009
aS"Chapter 15\n\nI'd never skydived or bungee jumped before; I had no experience with free fall and barely any even with contact sports. My angle was wrong."
p2010
aS"I realized this as my foot left the wood of the cylinder, realized there was no way to correct my course. I'd shoved off at too steep an angle. I was going to fall beneath him."
p2011
aS"Desperate, I reached my hand up, but he was one step ahead of me. He couldn't reach me, but grabbed for the rope trailing behind me, tied to my ankle."
p2012
aS'Then it went taut and I jerked to a stop, the rope around my leg yanking me back with a stab of pain and flipping me upside down.'
p2013
aS'I swung in sickening arcs, head twisting from side to side trying to understand what was happening, but for a moment nothing made sense,'
p2014
aS"my headlight strobing through images I couldn't assemble into a coherent whole: a length of blue and white rope, a swinging body, a line of dusty floorboards."
p2015
aS"Frantic, I reached up and grabbed the rope, pulling myself more or less upright, swaying dizzyingly.\n\nI took a breath but it didn't help."
p2016
aS'I dangled thirty feet below the cylinder, two ends of the same rope rising to curve up its top side towards the anchor of bed they were wrapped around, now out of sight. Beneath me, Elder Niko swung from his end of the rope.'
p2017
aS"His side happened to have been longer and he'd therefore come to a rougher stop than me; he was gasping, momentum swinging him in sickening arcs over the void beneath us.\n\nI looked up for younger Niko, and immediately regretted it."
p2018
aS"He'd stopped his fall by grabbing hold of my rope, but he wasn't tied to it, and was far enough above me that the bottom side of the cylinder was within reach, upside-down furniture bolted to its surface."
p2019
aS'And before I could open my mouth to scream _No!_ he leapt for it.'
p2020
aS"He arced across empty space, smashing into an overloaded and upside-down black bookshelf that I'm pretty sure was an IKEA Billy."
p2021
aS'He grabbed for a shelf but it pulled free, designed to resist only force pulling it down;'
p2022
aS"books flew everywhere, but Niko's grip flashed to the solid side of the bookshelf and he jerked to a halt, clinging like a confused squirrel to the angled side of the bookcase."
p2023
aS'The rope creaked uneasily. I looked down. Elder Niko was climbing his rope, hand over hand. Murder in his eyes.'
p2024
aS"I leapt up mine, for a second sure I'd be faster. I had a head start. I was twenty years younger."
p2025
aS"But my life hadn't been given over to surviving down here, to stalking, to killing. And my slack coiled beneath me: a leash, tied to my waist.\n\nElder reached the loop and hung his full weight on it."
p2026
aS'I slipped four feet before my grip on the rope was firm enough to stop me, friction-burned hands screaming.'
p2027
aS'Below me, he laughed, and sprang up the rope like it was a ladder. My arm muscles were already aching. Before I could pull myself up more than a foot or two, his hand closed around my ankle.'
p2028
aS"I strained to pull away, kicking. I looked up. Younger Niko's gaze met mine; he clung to the slanting bookcase, skiwampus, casting around for a way to help, but there was nothing in reach. He couldn't help me."
p2029
aS'I looked down and saw the same face, shriveled in a blink by decades of rage into something monstrous.'
p2030
aS'"We don\'t have to do this," I panted, still trying to shake my leg free from his cold grasp. "We can all go through, get to the surface. Then go our separate ways. Like you said."'
p2031
aS'"You fucking idiot." With the hand not gripping me he fumbled at his belt. "You thought after all this time down here I\'d _forgive_ you? That we could be friends again like old times? No. You\'re going to die.'
p2032
aS'And then I\'ll hunt that bitch down"---his eyes flashed up to his younger clone---"and kill him, again. First things first, though." And he reached up with the knife he\'d unclipped from his belt, flipped it open, and sawed into my calf.'
p2033
aS"I screamed, trying to pull away, but his other hand gripped my leg tight, and I looked up through the pain and starred vision at my Niko's shocked,"
p2034
aS'helpless, too-distant face, and below me his double laughed and kept sawing with terrible strength.'
p2035
aS'In one fierce thrust he sawed through my jeans and into my skin, and drew the serrated blade back, cutting deeper, into flesh, into muscle.'
p2036
aS'"It\'s your fault," he grunted, and the strength drained from my hands as hot pain sliced through me.'
p2037
aS'"Everything. All of it. Your lies. Your schemes." My blood dribbled onto his face and he spat it away. "A chain of bullshit. Unbroken." He pulled the blade back and I screamed, trying to twist away, but he only gripped me more firmly.'
p2038
aS'"Bet you never thought it\'d end like this, though, did you?"'
p2039
aS"He sawed the blade deeper and I screamed and realized, then, that I couldn't escape this, couldn't escape him,"
p2040
aS"that if I didn't die from falling or bleeding out or being left for dead the best I could hope for would be a life down here in the dark, like him, left to wander forever, trapped, helpless, lost."
p2041
aS"Fighting it was impossible. It was already done and settled, and had been from the moment we'd first set foot Downstairs, from the moment we saw the house, from the moment we'd first met."
p2042
aS'"He won\'t forgive you, either." He grimaced up at his younger self through teeth stained red by my blood. "He just hasn\'t realized it yet."'
p2043
aS'"He\'s not you," I gasped, "he\'ll never be you." And because I couldn\'t make myself believe it I stomped down on his face as hard as I could.'
p2044
aS'He let out a _whoof_ of air and something crunched as a splatter of blood arced out into darkness. His eyes rolled up into his head and he went limp, and then he fell.'
p2045
aS'In thirty feet he reached the end of the rope around his waist and it jerked him to a horrible stop, flailing his limbs like a scarecrow. He dangled there, spread-eagled, face up, over the void. Unmoving.'
p2046
aS'Somewhere above me Niko was whooping in victory, but I barely heard him through the blood thumping in my ears, the high-pitched scream of pain in my leg. Refocusing my eyes, I dragged them down. The knife was still embedded in my calf.'
p2047
aS'As if from a great distance, I reached with one hand, gripping the rope tight with the other, and pulled it free in a queasy sucking motion. Blood dribbled down my pant leg, dripping off my foot.'
p2048
aS'Numbness and pain rippled through me, and muscles spasmed in my arm, but there was something I had to do before any other concerns. Woozy, I pressed the knife to the second rope, and started to saw.'
p2049
aS'"No, wait!" Niko shouted down at me. "The key! Do you have the key?"'
p2050
aS'I looked up, blade held against the rope. "What?"'
p2051
aS'"To get back to our side." His voice seemed distant, swallowed up by the canyon of insulation. Maybe I was losing more blood than I realized. "The doorway\'s close. It has to be. But you need to get the key."\n\n_Front pocket, right side._'
p2052
aS"Below me, Elder Niko still swayed at the end of his rope, eyes closed. Motionless. I didn't think I could have killed him, but I must have knocked him out.\n\n_Or he wants you to think you did, anyway._"
p2053
aS"I still held the knife against the rope. Loose white innards strained free from the cut I'd started, escaping the tension of the deadweight below.\n\nBut the cut was still shallow, tentative."
p2054
aS'Uncommitted.\n\nI nudged the knife closed, shoved it into my belt.'
p2055
aS'"Hurry," Niko hissed above me.'
p2056
aS'"Thanks," I muttered. "Helpful."\n\nI started down.'
p2057
aS'I climbed fast, muscles trembling. The silence unsettled, now that no one was talking or scrambling or trying to kill anyone. It felt like the surrounding darkness was a blanket, muffling, infinitely thick.'
p2058
aS'A dangerous unreality was taking hold, like this was a video game. A dream. I shook my head, fighting mental fog. Tried to feel the pain in my leg, to let it be an anchor to keep me from floating away.'
p2059
aS"I got to the end of my rope and realized I had a problem. When I'd looped it around the bed I hadn't bothered to even out the two sides. And now, at the end of mine, I was still a few body lengths above Niko. I couldn't reach him."
p2060
aS'His side had happened to be the longer one, and the only way down to him now would be climbing the last few feet on the other end of the rope. His end.\n\nWhich meant detaching myself from mine.'
p2061
aS'With one hand I scrabbled pitifully at the knot, but untying it was hopeless for half-a-dozen reasons, my weight on it not the least. There was only one way to get off my rope onto his.'
p2062
aS'Below me, Elder Niko let out a gormless groan, head lolling to one side. But his eyes stayed closed.'
p2063
aS"A strange clarity had descended on me, the disconnected panic that comes from piling bad decisions on bad decisions, realizing you've gone too far but no longer able to stop."
p2064
aS"Shifting my grip to Niko's rope, I flipped open the knife again, and before indecision could paralyze me, I cut through my own rope, just above the knot at my waist."
p2065
aS"It was done. His rope creaked as it took my weight. I tried not to hear it. Tucking the knife into my belt, I lowered myself the last few feet to Elder Niko's body."
p2066
aS'He was still splayed out, spread-eagled, face up, eyes closed. Blood and spittle drooled from the corner of his mouth.\n\nHis fingers twitched in gentle spasms, the last motions of a dying insect.'
p2067
aS'We were surrounded by darkness.'
p2068
aS'Gripping the rope with one numbing fist, I reached out with my other hand, fingers brushing the edge of his pocket. He groaned again, flopped his head sideways.\n\nI pushed my fingers inside, feeling for the key.'
p2069
aS'There.'
p2070
aS'I pulled it free, carefully, gripping tight as the tines tugged the lining of his pocket, caught on its edge.'
p2071
aS'I focused all my attention on not dropping it, not letting it tumble down into oblivion; on pulling my hand slowly, deliberately, out of his pocket.'
p2072
aS'Which is why I didn\'t notice his eyes had opened. Not until his hand closed around my wrist.\n\n"The fuck," he muttered, lids heavy, speech slurred, "you doing down there?"'
p2073
aS'His grip on me was weak, but I felt the gathering awareness in him, like a coiling viper. His face was smeared with blood, and more had rushed to his head as he dangled, making his face look misshapen, swollen.'
p2074
aS'One of his pupils had dilated all the way open, and a blood vessel in the eye had burst, a spidery red blotch reaching tendrils through the white. He looked monstrous.'
p2075
aS'"I let you swim through first," he muttered, eyelids fluttering closed. "Can\'t remember. Why. Guess I thought I still owed you. A debt." He blinked, coughed. "Stupid. Wrong. Couldn\'t find my way. Back up.'
p2076
aS'Think about that mistake every day, every day, every day..."'
p2077
aS"I let him rant. Maybe he didn't know what he was saying."
p2078
aS"But I saw him then with a sudden chill clarity. I understood he was only monstrous because of what I'd done to him. And I'd only done it because of what he'd done to me."
p2079
aS'"I\'m sorry," I said, gently pulling free of his grip and slipping the key into my pocket. He scrabbled at my waist with his other hand, pathetic, as if trying to get a grip on my belt to pull himself up. "Sorry for dragging you down here.'
p2080
aS'You deserved... someone better than me to be your friend. And you can hurt me, hunt me, kill me as many times as you want but it\'ll never change that. Never take it back." I took a deep breath. "But I can\'t let you do it any more.'
p2081
aS'You don\'t deserve to die, but..." My eyes flicked up, then back to his. "Neither does he."'
p2082
aS'He smiled, blood spilling from the corner of his mouth, and as it dribbled away something changed. Like the light had shifted, popped a shadow into a shape. Like noticing the gorilla in the crowd.'
p2083
aS'The confusion in his eyes had been a lie. They were perfectly clear.\n\n"Too bad," he said, "no one gets what they deserve."'
p2084
aS"He had the knife in his hand. My belt. He'd slipped it off my belt while I was babbling."
p2085
aS"I swung sideways as he lunged it at my face, and it nicked my ear. There was no grogginess in him, no disorientation. I'd just seen what I'd wanted to see, one last time. I'd never really seen him at all."
p2086
aS"My muscles tensed to fling myself back up the rope, but without the knife I'd never make it. Never be free of him. Certainty flushed through me. This had to end. This had to be the last time."
p2087
aS'He lunged again and I grabbed his wrist, wrenching it backwards, trying to pull the knife free. He snarled and reached for me with his other hand but I twisted away.'
p2088
aS"We swayed and twirled at the end of the rope, the rope I was no longer tied to, clinging instead with one desperate, trembling hand. I felt fibers snapping as the cut I'd started above us frayed, grew larger."
p2089
aS'One way or another this was about to end.'
p2090
aS'He stabbed at my face again and I swung to the side, just enough for his hand to brush past me, so I bit down on it as hard as I could. He swore as I ground down harder, feeling flesh give, tasting blood.'
p2091
aS"Sensing his grip loosen, I snatched the knife, his expression of shock burned into my vision even as I turned away, already climbing. Maybe I'd never done that before, in all the times he'd attacked me. Maybe I'd never fought back."
p2092
aS'I climbed, the knife clenched between my teeth. For a fleeting moment, and maybe for the first time in my life, I felt like a badass.'
p2093
aS"But I'd bought myself only seconds and not enough. I'd pushed well past the limit of my endurance. I barely had the strength to pull myself up. I'd put a few body lengths between us, but he could swallow that lead in seconds."
p2094
aS'I was a wounded rabbit limping from a wolf.'
p2095
aS'Below me something screamed and I realized it was him; a terrible scream, rage and pain and loneliness and betrayal etched onto air. He started up the rope after me.'
p2096
aS'"Get. Back. Here." He growled. "Get the fuck. Back down here. I\'m not finished. With you."'
p2097
aS'Bloodstained rage twisted his face. He was gaining. He was going to end me.\n\nAnd then a dictionary clobbered him in the face.'
p2098
aS'I looked up, shocked, at a triumphant Niko shaking a fist down at us. "Leave him the fuck alone, dickweed!"'
p2099
aS"He'd clambered up on the tilted side of the bookshelf, another heavy hardback already in his hand. He hefted it, gaged the distance, and flung."
p2100
aS"The angle was awkward for throwing, and this time the missile went wide, plummeting down into darkness with its pages aflutter, like they wanted to take wing. But he'd already grabbed another book."
p2101
aS'Below me, his elder was shaking off the blow.\n\nI climbed.'
p2102
aS'Niko kept throwing books, and some collided with my pursuer, enough to throw him off balance, to buy me more seconds. I needed every one. I was fading fast, and so was the rope. Muscles tore and fibers snapped.'
p2103
aS'My vision shrunk to a wavering tunnel, only my hands and the rope visible in the deepening blackness.'
p2104
aS'I climbed.'
p2105
aS"I climbed with some reserve of strength I'd never guessed I had.\n\nI reached the notch in the rope and climbed a few feet past it, spit the knife into my hand, and started to saw."
p2106
aS'"Faster," someone was muttering, maybe me, "faster."'
p2107
aS"The Niko below flung himself up the rope. He'd almost reached me."
p2108
aS"A crushing inevitability pressed into me, from tingling arms to kicking feet. Someone had already won. Someone would live. The clock would run out and we'd find out who.\n\n_Faster._"
p2109
aS'Fibers twisted, stretched, broke free.\n\nA copy of _Dhalgren_ arced smoothly by my head.'
p2110
aS'Guttural noises just beneath me. It was too late. He was here.\n\nAnd then the rope split.'
p2111
aS'He was at my feet. He flung himself at them when he heard the tear of the rope giving way, but had nothing to push off, no momentum to save him. He scrambled frantic as the rope went weightless in his hands, a finger brushing my shoe.'
p2112
aS'Then he fell.'
p2113
aS"Within a second he'd plunged past the range of our lights, swallowed by blackness. Only then, after losing sight of him, did he scream, and there was no fear in it at all. Just rage."
p2114
aS'But it was a tiny sound, eaten up by miles of pink insulation, fading fast and not repeated.'
p2115
aS'He was gone.'
p2116
aS'PART THREE\n\nMANIFOLDWISE\n\nFrom "Ode: Of Wit," Abraham Cowley (1618-1667):\n\n"Some things do through our judgment pass\nAs through a multiplying glass.'
p2117
aS'And sometimes, if the object be too far,\nWe take a falling meteor for a star."'
p2118
aS"Chapter 16\n\nI woke up from a dreamless sleep to face the unpleasant truth that we couldn't stay here forever."
p2119
aS'Getting back on top of the cylinder had been like navigating an especially surreal and challenging climbing gym.'
p2120
aS'From his perch on the bookshelf, Niko had scoped out a route from one piece of furniture to the next, and then,'
p2121
aS'in what would have been the most viral parkour video ever if YouTube had been invented yet, leapt from one to the other, till gasping, he scrabbled up to the top of the tube.'
p2122
aS'From there he could pull me up; all I had to do with my shredded muscles was keep hanging on, although that was hard enough.'
p2123
aS"Once we'd made it,\nI thought nothing in the world had ever felt so good as lying on my back on a floor, every muscle gloriously unclenched.\n\nWedged in between two dressers, so as not to roll off the edge, we slept."
p2124
aS"When we woke we ate power bars from Niko's pack: my own had gotten lost somewhere in the fight, probably sliding off the curve and down into the darkness below."
p2125
aS"I had no idea where to go from here---although it seemed like there were only two options, one way down the tube or the other---but Niko had found a better option while he'd been scrambling around up top."
p2126
aS'Directly under the invisible anchor point of the densest part of the web, the chandelier itself, was a trapdoor. It opened downward with a creak when you pushed on it, releasing fold-up stairs like the ones that sometimes climb into attics.'
p2127
aS'The stairs descended some fifteen feet to a cement floor bisecting the cylinder. Its upper half was a domed tunnel, vanishing into the distance in either direction.'
p2128
aS'Bare bulbs hung from the roof every fifty feet or so, leaking dim puddles of yellow-orange glow. Water ran down the center in a foot-deep trench, fast enough to gurgle.'
p2129
aS'We kept to the level ground on either side of the trench, and started trudging.'
p2130
aS'We moved slowly. Niko had cleaned up the cut in my lower leg as best he could, bandaging it with some socks from a dresser drawer and a tight-wrapped bungee cord from his pack. But it hurt, a lot.'
p2131
aS"I hobbled more than walked, had to stop for frequent breaks, or lean on him for support. He helped me without comment, when I needed it.\n\nI couldn't help notice, up close to him like that, that he seemed to have all his fingers."
p2132
aS'Unsaid things festered between us.'
p2133
aS'The tunnel had no perceptible slope, but the water in the trench ran fast, rushing eagerly past us. The path stayed straight at first but then began to curve gently leftward. We walked for what felt like a long time.'
p2134
aS'Gradually, the perfect curve of the ceiling began to straighten. The roof above flattened, the curves at its edge sharpening, until they squared off entirely. At the same time the tunnel gradually shrunk back to house-sized dimensions.'
p2135
aS'Presently we were walking down a rectangular hall of concrete, like some forgotten subbasement in a shuttered factory.'
p2136
aS"There were no side doors, no other stairs up. There were no decisions to make. We just walked. Other than an occasional grunt or word of coordination, we didn't speak. A small part of me wanted to ask a million questions."
p2137
aS"Another part didn't want the answers. There was a tautness between us, a strain, like a handshake stripped down to bone and gristle, rubbing, raw. I realized maybe it had been there a long time, underneath everything we'd wrapped around it."
p2138
aS'Mostly we were just too tired for talking.'
p2139
aS'Up ahead, the tunnel ended in a cramped room. After a few more minutes of trudging we reached it.'
p2140
aS"It was a squat and vaulted brick antechamber, maybe twelve feet across and hexagonal, with tunnels coming in from all six sides. Each seemed identical to the one we'd entered from."
p2141
aS'Water flooded the sunken floor of the chamber and ran out the trenches in the middle of each tunnel.'
p2142
aS"In the center of the room, under the water, was a stubby concrete pillar topped by a metal hatchway with a wheel, like something you'd see on a submarine.\n\nI knew before checking that the hatch would have a keyhole."
p2143
aS'Once we confirmed it did, we became strangely hesitant, our momentum lost. We perched on the lip of a tunnel, dangling our feet in the water, using the excuse that we needed a rest.'
p2144
aS"There was so much I should be asking him, so much I should be saying, but I couldn't find a way to start."
p2145
aS"Well. I had pretended nothing was wrong for such a long time. Maybe another few minutes wouldn't hurt."
p2146
aS"* * *\n\nThe rippling sounds of the water were peaceful, and I didn't want to break the silence. But someone had to."
p2147
aS'"So." The sound bounced off vaulted brick, making the chamber even more claustrophobic. I coughed. "We\'ve come all this way. We going through, or what?"'
p2148
aS'He seemed curiously reluctant, but managed a weak smile. "Sure! Yeah. Let\'s do it."'
p2149
aS'We waded over to the hatchway. The wheel was inches under the surface of the water. I pulled the key from my pocket and slipped it into the lock, and it went in smoothly.'
p2150
aS'I spun it through a full turn till it made a tiny _chunk_, then turned the wheel. After a few revolutions, something gave, and we found we could swing the circular hatch open along one hinged side.'
p2151
aS'We held our glowsticks underwater near the opening. The hatch opened into an ordinary-looking but flooded room beneath us with a yellow-tiled floor. Chrome and porcelain rippled up at us.'
p2152
aS'We realized after a moment it was a flooded bathroom.'
p2153
aS'"The other guys are probably doing the same thing on their side," I said hopefully. "Maybe we\'ll swim through at exactly the same time, go past each other."'
p2154
aS'"Huh." I looked over; he was staring uneasily into the flooded opening. He caught me looking and forced a smile. "Why not, right? Makes as much sense as anything else."'
p2155
aS"But his gaze slipped off me and up to the vaulted ceiling, like he was interested in the architecture. He wasn't.\n\nHe was worried about something."
p2156
aS'I turned away, ignoring the upwelling of unease, and frowned at the hatch. There was something familiar inside it. I squinted, trying to make the wavering underwater shapes resolve.'
p2157
aS"Tied to something just under the hatchway was a climbing rope, the same kind we'd used with our Grip Monkeys. It stretched down in a taut line out of sight, towards the hidden wall of the room beneath us."
p2158
aS'Niko\'d seen it too and reached into the hatch to give it a tug; it seemed taut. "Thirty-five meter rope," he said. "Looks like someone marked the way through."\n\n"Our doubles?"'
p2159
aS'He shrugged. "Sure."'
p2160
aS'"And this goes through to another hatch like this one, you think? One that opens up onto our original side?"'
p2161
aS'He nodded, still not looking at me. "What my evil twin was looking for. The way back through. And if we\'re lucky, our doubles will be waiting on the other side. Just like this. Getting ready to swap places, swim through.'
p2162
aS'Get everyone back where they belong, all neat and tidy."'
p2163
aS'"And, uh. You know this how?" I swallowed. Here was the discussion I\'d been too afraid to start, happening anyway.'
p2164
aS'He tensed, frowning at his submerged shoes. "I don\'t _know_ it. But we might as well believe it, because if they\'re not there, and there\'s no more synchronicity between us at all any more? Then who the fuck knows where this rope leads."'
p2165
aS'He shook his head. "No. They\'re over there. We have to believe that. They\'re having this same discussion, right now."\n\n"_They._"'
p2166
aS"My voice broke and he looked up startled, guilty, afraid. Like a texting jaywalker realizing too late he's wandered into traffic."
p2167
aS'"Niko," I said, trembling. "Are you sure you\'re... I mean, when we got separated..."'
p2168
aS'Somewhere far below us, something _groaned_, low, immense. The ground quivered, like a mountain turning over in its sleep, and the surface of the water pinched and jittered in sympathy.'
p2169
aS'We both dropped half into a crouch, but the earthquake stopped, the low rumbles far beneath us faded. The water we stood in sloshed drunkenly.'
p2170
aS'"What the shit was that?" I breathed.'
p2171
aS'"I don\'t know." He nodded, coming to a decision. "But we\'d better hurry this up. So. You should go first."'
p2172
aS'"Excuse me?" I blinked.'
p2173
aS'"You\'re the better swimmer." He was talking fast, shooting uneasy glances at the walls around us. "If there\'s anything unexpected or it\'s too far or whatever, you can come on back.'
p2174
aS'But if you make it through safe, tug the rope a couple times and I\'ll follow."'
p2175
aS'"I thought we\'d go together." Something was wrong again. The dark circle of the submerged porthole was ominous. Unknown. This was happening way too fast. "I don\'t want to go alone."'
p2176
aS'"It\'s the only way." He gazed at me, fierce. "Orion, just trust me, okay? This will all work out, but you need to trust me right now. Can you do that?"'
p2177
aS'I wanted to laugh. _Trust?_ Could we _trust_ each other? The question unraveled into a million strands, tendrils stretching back through everything that had happened down here, and everything that had happened before that.'
p2178
aS'"No." I shook my head, mind racing. It felt like riding a bike that kept slipping gears, nothing quite fitting together, accelerating down a hill with less and less control, no way to stop. "No. I can\'t do this again.'
p2179
aS'Why won\'t any of you be honest with me? Stop it. I know. _I know._"'
p2180
aS'The ground trembled again, and Niko took a staggering step toward me, grabbing my arm. "Stop," he gasped, "Ryan, stop. Don\'t say it."\n\n"He showed me a finger," I whispered.'
p2181
aS'"Shut up," he shouted. "Look. Here\'s what\'s going to happen. You and your double will swim through together, then me and mine after, and everything will be _fine_."'
p2182
aS'"But the other Niko," I gasped, shaking my head, "he\'s---"\n\nThe ground dropped out from under us, like a plane hitting turbulence. Rumbles quivered in stone far below.'
p2183
aS'I tripped and plunged into water up to my neck as the earth swayed, groaned like a buried titan coming back to life.'
p2184
aS'Niko grabbed my arm and pulled me up, put his other on my shoulder, pulled me against him and shouted in my face: "Shut up!'
p2185
aS'Shut up, you fucking idiot, stop talking, stop overthinking everything and just swim through the goddamned tunnel,'
p2186
aS'just swim the fuck through, it\'s the only way you\'re going to---" And he cut himself off, biting his lip, his eyes filling up with tears.'
p2187
aS'And then I got it.\n\nSynchronicity.'
p2188
aS'I felt like we were balanced on an impossibly heavy pivot, a mountain peak turned upside down. If we leaned too far in any direction...'
p2189
aS'Two soap bubbles, pressed together, floating in a vast empty void. Trembling.'
p2190
aS'He knew. He knew there was no other Niko to swim through. Not any more.'
p2191
aS'The surface of the water twitched, rippled. Waiting.'
p2192
aS'He let go of me, took a step back, face reddening. "I just think," he said quietly, miserable, "that you should go first, okay?"\n\nThe walls around us crunched, coughed, like millions of brick bones having chiropractic work done.'
p2193
aS'Maybe it was my imagination, but the room seemed smaller.'
p2194
aS'And then something else hit me. Something so hard and huge I forgot how to breathe, and staggered back away from it.'
p2195
aS"_I let you swim through first. Can't remember. Why._\n\nBricks cracked and popped around us, exploding like popcorn."
p2196
aS"_Couldn't find my way. Back up._"
p2197
aS'He was reaching for me but I tripped backwards, reflecting his concern with horror. _No. No, no, no._ As each brick popped others surged into the gaps they made. The walls were squeezing closer. The room was barely nine feet across, now.'
p2198
aS'Water surged into the runnels leading out, cascading away in all directions like it, too, was terrified.'
p2199
aS'"It\'s okay," Niko was saying, smiling through the tears. But it wasn\'t. He hadn\'t been close enough to hear what his elder had been whispering. _He didn\'t know._ "If it doesn\'t work I\'ll just stay on this side, retrace our route. No biggie.'
p2200
aS'Get back to the top and so what if there\'s some headaches and the shadows are weird. I\'ll deal."'
p2201
aS'"No." I shook my head. "This can\'t be what happens, it\'s not right, it\'s not fair, it can\'t end like this..." Something was slipping from my grasp.'
p2202
aS"I tried to hold on to all the stories I'd told myself about Niko, about me; all the endings I'd wanted for us."
p2203
aS'Each of them were tales disguised as truths; worlds that I yearned to slip into like tailored gloves, sized just right;'
p2204
aS"stories reassuring me that I finally understood what I deserved, good or bad, where I belonged and who I belonged to, and who belonged to me, where I didn't have to be afraid that I'd love the wrong person or the wrong person would love me."
p2205
aS"But people don't wrap up like that into nice little cages, contained. We weren't each others' stories. I wasn't Bradley's and Niko wasn't mine and I wasn't his, no matter how much at times we'd wanted to be."
p2206
aS"We'd mistaken shadows for substance, all of us: chased them and failed, of course, to grab them, become shadows ourselves in failing."
p2207
aS"But we weren't shadows. We were more than that. We deserved more."
p2208
aS"Something swayed inside me, as if I'd let go of one handhold and gripped another, shifting my weight even though I wasn't sure the new grip would hold. But by then I'd already done it, already committed. And it held. It didn't let me fall."
p2209
aS'"No," I said again, but stronger this time, stepping forward into the shrinking space, barely the size of a closet now and still getting smaller, "No. This isn\'t how this ends."'
p2210
aS'And as the words bounced off the contracting brick that had nearly reached our heads, it held still. The rumbles and groans around us went dead. Everything paused. Everything held its breath.'
p2211
aS"I looked at him and I tried to see him. Really see him. I willed the layers of muck and confusion between us to pull back, to clear away and reveal someone, at last, who I could understand. The Niko who forgave me. The Niko I'd hurt."
p2212
aS"The Nikos I'd saved, damned, slept with; the ones who needed me, who hated me, who wanted me dead. The one I'd tried so hard to find, looked everywhere for, down here, up there, inside us both and beyond possibility."
p2213
aS'None of them were here. The only one here was him.'
p2214
aS'"You don\'t owe me anything," I said, "but I owe you this. At least this." My voice was hoarse at first but I willed more of my growing conviction into it.'
p2215
aS'"Maybe you\'re right and going through together, coming face to face with it, would be bad. But maybe not. You think it\'s coincidence that every cockeyed theory we\'ve had about this place has turned out right? I don\'t.'
p2216
aS'If it\'s feeding off us, multiplying us, then we\'re the prime factor. The base case. You think that if we see the truth, we\'ll be destroyed. Well, fuck that. I reject it. I reject it with every ounce of my goddamn being."'
p2217
aS'I took a deep breath. "Maybe synchronicity matters, maybe it doesn\'t. I don\'t really give a shit. What I want is to get us both back home. Look, I don\'t deserve your trust, and maybe I don\'t know how to give it to anyone else.'
p2218
aS'But if I have to start somewhere I should start with myself. And I think I can do this. I _trust_ I can. Okay? I made Tiger Shark in swim club and I can hold my breath for three minutes and I can make it. I can make it through. I can.'
p2219
aS'And you are fucking coming with me, because I may be the reason you\'re down here but I swear to god I will also be the reason you get back out."'
p2220
aS'The words lingered in the air. We stayed suspended for a moment, unable to break eye contact, afraid, maybe, to look at anything but each other.'
p2221
aS"A single brick tumbled from the ceiling and made a tremendous splash. We both started, then laughed, and couldn't stop laughing. We were buried alive and almost certainly going to die but goddamn, we were going to do it together."
p2222
aS'"Yeah." He took a breath, then another. "Yeah, okay. We\'ll try it your way. You win. This time, dipshit."'
p2223
aS'It was decided. It felt good, and yet painful, too, as some pinprick of knowledge stabbed into me, saying even if we did survive, nothing would ever be the same between us.'
p2224
aS'So without overthinking it I stepped forward and hugged him, fierce as the roiling lump in my throat.'
p2225
aS'His bare skin, still damp, felt hot against my own. He held me tight, wet curls rubbing against my face. Heat passed between us, but it was the least of what had.'
p2226
aS"We'd loved each other, at times. Even if the people we'd loved were mostly in our heads."
p2227
aS'It was nice, but his curls were tickling my nose, and I pulled back before I meant to, reflecting his surprise at this with embarrassment.'
p2228
aS'For a second it looked like he thought I was going to kiss him, and then I thought maybe he was thinking of kissing me,'
p2229
aS'out of some kind of misplaced solidarity, and we both stood uncertain for a second or two before dropping arms and stepping back.'
p2230
aS'Awkward. But sort of perfect for the mismatched shape of us, which was, if nothing else, our own.'
p2231
aS'I turned away, toward the submerged portal, the way out, the way home. I stared down at it.'
p2232
aS'The thought of swimming into that hole without knowing the way to the other side stabbed a different part of me, the one concerned with oxygen and continued existence.'
p2233
aS'I pushed the fear down but it kept manufacturing images for me: jeans snagging on hidden nails that held me back while I flailed uselessly;'
p2234
aS'huge dead fish swimming the flooded halls with flaking gray skin, bulging eyes growing larger and larger as they closed on me.'
p2235
aS'I imagined drowning. Breathing water instead of air. Spasms of lungs. Knowing you were about to die, only not soon enough. Not nearly soon enough.'
p2236
aS'Almost on autopilot I guided Niko through what to expect, through breathing exercises, stroke technique. Calming him down as much as myself. Preparing.'
p2237
aS'We started to breathe, deeper and deeper. Priming our lungs with all the air we could.'
p2238
aS"I stared at the circular opening, visualized the motions I'd make. I tried to believe I could do this. I tried to push down the sliver of doubt lodged somewhere in my throat."
p2239
aS"Gripping the sides of the hatch, I paused. I wasn't ready. But if I waited any longer, I'd never be."
p2240
aS'"Last one back to the right dimension buys the drinks," I said, then took one last huge breath and dove headfirst into the hatch.'
p2241
aS'Chapter 17\n\nThe room below was, in fact, a bathroom, lined with tile that might have been a pale yellow but glowed red in the light of our glowsticks. Chromium sink fixtures and a frosted-glass shower threw back fiery light.'
p2242
aS'In contrast to the other flooded chambers there was no mold, no algae, no water damage. It might have been flooded seconds before.'
p2243
aS"I didn't pause to wonder about this, but kicked off through the open door into a murky hall, following the guide rope which led onwards like Niko had predicted. He followed behind, pulling himself hand over hand along the rope."
p2244
aS'I focused on my strokes, old swimming lessons coming back. This was a different sort of lane, of course: the floor brown carpet, plaster-of-paris above instead of a shimmering boundary of air.'
p2245
aS"And the wounded leg slowed me down: it hurt, every time I kicked. But I wasn't worried, not yet. I had good lungs. I could swim for a while."
p2246
aS'The rope turned a corner into a large unfurnished room with a half-dozen washers and dryers piled in a corner. We swam past them, mechanical, calm, following the rope through an open doorway opposite.'
p2247
aS'Through the door was what looked like a small porch or mud room. Boots and shoes tumbled weightless in the water. The rope stopped here, tied to a capped metal pipe. The opposite wall was a sliding glass patio door.\n\nThe airlock.'
p2248
aS'Through the glass it was dark. But faintly, through water rippling as if moving with strange, hot currents, there: another sliding door.'
p2249
aS"Distance was impossible to judge, but it couldn't have been more than twenty-five or thirty feet away, suspended in a dark and empty void.\n\nAnd framed in that window was a figure, silhouetted by the red glowstick he was holding."
p2250
aS'Another me.\n\nIt could have been a mirror, except he was alone.'
p2251
aS"The water trembled and around us foundations groaned, but I reached down and grabbed Niko's hand and held it tight against the wriggling water, and he gripped it back. We stared across the gap at my double, defiant."
p2252
aS"I realized half the sick anxiety I'd been feeling was from my growing proximity to him, subsumed by the general terror of what we were doing. But that wasn't why I gripped Niko's hand so tight."
p2253
aS"We were breaking the rules of this place. Staring asynchrony in the face. And we weren't backing down.\n\nWe were going through anyway."
p2254
aS'The rumbling petered out, died away. Shoes disturbed by the shaking drifted around us, their long laces waving like antennae.'
p2255
aS'All this had taken only seconds. I knew every one mattered. Across the gap I saw the other Ryan reach for his sliding glass door, and found myself doing the same, unsure which of us had moved first.'
p2256
aS'In lockstep, our doors slid open, and we swam forward into the black water between, me tugging Niko behind. As we reached the portal the floor and ceiling dropped away. Everything was dark.'
p2257
aS'And as we swam past the threshold something _changed_.'
p2258
aS'Everything changed. The water cooled; the pressure and ambient sound in my ears shifted.'
p2259
aS'The other sliding door was just ahead of us, but it seemed too as if we floated in a cavernous space, a space beyond measuring, the other door impossibly distant.'
p2260
aS"Disoriented, I turned around to shut the one we'd come through---remembering they couldn't both be open at once---and as I did another shock of _change_ swept through me, crystallizing into something immense, yawning, terrorful."
p2261
aS'I remembered the spring Elder Niko had spoken of\n\n EXPANDING ONCE AGAIN\n\ndeep at the roots of this place: a spring that split and split and split again, endless.'
p2262
aS'I felt possibilities branching in the water around me, but even more in the waters inside me, in the part of me inside the waters.'
p2263
aS'Branching, expanding, growing like mold in a petri dish but spilling out of the dish now, spreading through the lab into the walls, the world\n\n SUCH WONDERS\n\nand it was as if I was the mold,'
p2264
aS'the spring, an effervescent source spilling out into infinite variation, branches branching and branched again into an unfillable space, filling it.'
p2265
aS'Boundless, multiplied. Multiplicious.'
p2266
aS'Slowed by dream-syrup, fighting awed stupor from these whispers of immensity, I turned my back on that powerful water at the center,'
p2267
aS'pulled the glass door shut, staring numb as it slid implacable down its track, while behind me the other Ryan did the same.'
p2268
aS'Our doors clicked shut.'
p2269
aS'And as we turned around to swim across that heady gap, facing each other again, we both raised our glowsticks high. And then we saw them.'
p2270
aS'Drifting in that immense and empty space, lit a gangrenous red by our chemical lights, there were more of us.'
p2271
aS'Dozens. Floating, unbreathing. Eyes open.\n\nWatching.'
p2272
aS'I screamed, bubbles of precious oxygen exploding from my mouth, and then they came for us.'
p2273
aS"I twisted around and yanked the handle of the door, but it wouldn't budge. I clawed at it, slammed my fist against the glass."
p2274
aS"The door wouldn't open and they were right behind they were coming they were going to get us and\n\nI twisted\n\nwildly, pressed hands to the glass behind me, but it was hopeless."
p2275
aS'There were too many of them, drifting forward with hands outstretched, serene expressions on their faces.'
p2276
aS'Beside me, Niko was preparing to push off against the glass and make a break for the other side, but faltered as he saw what was happening across from us.'
p2277
aS"The other Ryan had failed to open his door, too, but as he'd turned around a coincidence had pried apart our synchronicity even further."
p2278
aS'There were more of the floating Ryan-things on his side---an accident of distribution maybe---and the few seconds Niko and I had to act had already run out for him. As he bent his legs to push off from the glass door, they reached him.'
p2279
aS'He screamed, eyes going wide as their fingers wrapped around his hair, caressed his arms, reached pale white fingers into his mouth. Bubbles of air exploded from it as he twisted frantically, trying to shake them off.'
p2280
aS'Hands closed around his neck, twisted his arms, pulled his head back by his hair to a terrible angle; hands that seemed unsure if they meant to caress or kill. He was panicking, writhing in the water like a trapped eel, dying.'
p2281
aS'Before we could move or even start swimming forward to help him, his body spasmed as he breathed in.\n\nHe _breathed in_.'
p2282
aS"It's a horrible thing to watch yourself drown."
p2283
aS'My brain disconnected, floated away, observed only in abstractions as the me across the gap spasmed and convulsed,'
p2284
aS'surrounded by things that shared our face, pressing forward, closer, eager, like they wanted to feed off the flicker of his death.'
p2285
aS'The guttering red of his thrashing glowstick was doubled, reflecting mirrored patterns in the glass behind him.\n\nSomething was wrong with that.'
p2286
aS"More of the Ryan-things were drifting toward us, Niko was yanking frantic at my arm, but I couldn't move, couldn't react, struggling to grasp that fleeting thought like a half-remembered dream. Neurons tried to spark."
p2287
aS'The doubled reflection. Something had almost slipped into place.'
p2288
aS'A glowstick and its reflection, now gone horribly still. But the closer one was occluded by the swarming forms, the shadows that swam around it.'
p2289
aS'The one in the reflection was clear. In the glass, its light was unobstructed.'
p2290
aS"In the glass, there were no swarming figures. They weren't real.\n\n_They weren't real._"
p2291
aS'There was no way, no time to explain this to Niko. So I wrapped my arms around him tight, felt for the glass door with my legs, shut my eyes, and pushed off hard towards the swarm of encroaching Orions, as hard as I could.'
p2292
aS'The pain in my wounded calf went white-hot but I barely noticed it. I shot straight forward, intent, right through the mass of things closing in.'
p2293
aS"Something brushed my leg. I kicked forward with all the strength I had. Two fingertips bounced off my forehead, trailed through my hair, but we were moving too fast for them, we were through, we were past them. I'd done it."
p2294
aS"We'd reached the glass door on the other side; below us, the drowned Orion sank into erasing darkness, no longer struggling. I couldn't help him."
p2295
aS"But Niko was kicking and thrashing in what I'd assumed was terror at the illusory Sham-Friends. To pull the door open I'd have to let him go. But as I did I realized the reason for his panic was far more serious.\n\nHe was out of air."
p2296
aS"Whether he'd lost the last of it screaming, whether his smoker's lungs were just inferior to mine: it didn't matter. I could tell at a glance he wouldn't make it to the other side. He wouldn't even make it through the door."
p2297
aS'His face was filled up with crushing desperation, a look that counted seconds until the overwhelming urge to breathe took hold of him. They were almost gone. His lungs were empty.'
p2298
aS'So I pressed my mouth to his and filled them up. I gave him the last of my breath.'
p2299
aS'His eyes went wide as he realized what I did, and I could feel him fight to pull back, to stop me.'
p2300
aS"But I held him tight, and anyway I knew he couldn't stop the desperate need of his lungs to expand, to survive, no matter what his forebrain thought it wanted."
p2301
aS'In moments, it was done. I was empty, and he was full.'
p2302
aS'He would live. He would be the one who made it.'
p2303
aS'I pulled back, and as I did the water exploded around us like it had come to life, gone in a snap from still to carbonated. All around us the architecture groaned, flexed, heaved, like it too had come alive.'
p2304
aS"Across the gap of thrumming water behind us I saw the glass door we'd come through pull back. Its dimensions and the reflection of my glowstick grew smaller.\n\nThe wall was pulling away."
p2305
aS'Desperate, my own need to breathe becoming overwhelming, I faced forward again and tugged the glass door beside us open; but even as I did, Downstairs expanded.'
p2306
aS'Plaster dust pillowed into the flooded hall in thick weightless clouds as the walls split and reformed, split and reformed, like bones breaking and healing and rebreaking, growing fractionally longer each time.'
p2307
aS"New glass doors spawned above us, below us, to every side. I ignored it all. I pulled the door open along its rail and grabbed Niko's arm to shove him through."
p2308
aS"He gripped the edge as I did, twisting around to grasp my shoulder. There were no words for the look on his face, or for all the things we'd never said to each other and now never would."
p2309
aS'There was no time to say them and no air to say them with. I could guess what some of them would have been, maybe, but not others.'
p2310
aS"There was so much of him I'd never really seen, never understood, too caught up in manufacturing other versions of him in my head to know the only one who'd really been there. Now I'd never know how much I'd missed."
p2311
aS'I pulled back gently from his grasping hand, and smiled, and tried to put everything left I wanted to say into that.'
p2312
aS'Water frothed around us, twisting, expanding. And then in a flash it began to move.'
p2313
aS"A current tore him from me, limbs flailing, pulling him backward through the mudroom and down the twin of the hall we'd swum through to get here, toward the other hatch. I hoped. Toward the right surface."
p2314
aS"Even if I'd wanted to follow, I couldn't have: another current of shockingly cold water had wrapped itself around me like a tendril. An angry, biotic undertow pulled me down, straight down, with vicious force."
p2315
aS'The reflection of my glowstick strobed as the current pulled me past door after door of sliding glass, faster and faster: a flicker, then a dull throb,'
p2316
aS'fading and mingling with the phantom patterns and flashes of color now dancing across my vision as my oxygen-starved brain began to shut down.'
p2317
aS"In a moment I'd breathe in, and I wondered what it would be like to inhale those waters of possibility, let that multiplying spring inside me. Let it fill me up. I harbored no illusions, of course: I'd seen it happen to the other Ryan."
p2318
aS"I'd die. But a beautiful way to go, in the abstract at least. A life spent worrying about possibilities would end by drowning in them. Neat."
p2319
aS'This peaceful thought had so taken me I was caught utterly by surprise when the current shifted and smashed me into a pane of glass with so much force it shattered.'
p2320
aS'Rocketing through a waterlogged hall of turbulent water, surrounded by tumbling fragments of glass, head throbbing and vision expiring,'
p2321
aS'I opened my mouth in shock and, before I could remember I was waiting for a poetic moment to die, breathed in.'
p2322
aS'EPILOGUE\n\nFrom "Ode: Of Wit," Abraham Cowley (1618-1667):\n\n"But love that moulds one man up out of two,\nMakes me forget and injure you.'
p2323
aS'I took you for myself sure when I thought\nThat you in anything were to be taught."\n\nI hope this finds you well, if it finds you at all.'
p2324
aS'I walked by our old house this morning. The whole yard was flooded, caution tape everywhere. Empty driveway. Whoever lives there now must have abandoned ship while they waited for the plumbers to sort it all out. But it gave me an idea.'
p2325
aS"Water gushing up from the basement windows. A mess. But I found a little whirlpool in the swamp of the front yard, a big exposed pipe sucking liquid back in. Back down. That's where I'll drop this, I suppose."
p2326
aS"That pipe might just lead to the city sewer system, but if I'm lucky, it goes a lot deeper."
p2327
aS"Maybe it would be better to let you keep thinking I'm dead. Maybe I shouldn't be writing this. But I think you'd rather know. There's a difference between dead and gone, despite the expression."
p2328
aS"I think you'd prefer knowing one Ryan, at least, survived. I never really did understand how you think, but I'm reasonably sure about that.\n\nAssuming, that is, you survived too."
p2329
aS"I think you did. That could be me projecting, one last time. But I don't know. It feels right that one of each of us made it out. Balanced.\n\nNot synchronous, but resolved."
p2330
aS"I don't have headaches here, which is weird, because it's not the place we started from. Elder Niko said there weren't just two sides, and I thought I got what he meant, but I've stopped trying to pretend we ever understood Downstairs."
p2331
aS"Anyway, it's different here. Chewing gum isn't a thing, and this asshole named Ted Cruz is president now, which feels like the worst possible timeline, but still. No headaches. This universe is not rejecting me."
p2332
aS"Maybe I should be insulted, but I suppose I'll have to take what I can get."
p2333
aS"You're not here. I'm pretty sure of that. Hopefully you ended up back where we started. Hopefully that part of the plan worked out."
p2334
aS"We never understood Downstairs, but that hasn't stopped me making up new theories. And I think we were wrong, about a lot of things."
p2335
aS'Well. Duh.'
p2336
aS"But for example: we always assumed our doubles were on the other side of the fridge from us. But I don't think that's right. I think it was worse than that."
p2337
aS"Sure, they were trapped just like we were when the fridge connection was broken. But we were wrong when we thought they'd been looking for a way to get back through. Because they were back already, where they belonged, on their own side."
p2338
aS'The problem was that two doppelgangers had followed them through.\n\nUs.'
p2339
aS'They figured it out a lot quicker than we did, I think. How that loss of synchronicity had pulled our twin houses partially apart, like a gardener starting to separate two potted flowers. How the easy way back had been sheared off.'
p2340
aS'So they had to figure out a different way to get rid of us. We were sleeping in their beds. Eating their food. Stealing their lives while they lurked below, afraid to come near us and push things even further out of sync.'
p2341
aS'Sneaking up to steal food in the middle of the night, thieves in their own house. And the only way to send us back was to find another connection point, a deeper one, down where roots still twined together. And prod us into finding it, too.'
p2342
aS'They had a lot more time to explore than we did. Downstairs became their home.'
p2343
aS"They couldn't explain things to us, not directly. Because if we'd also realized how much things had diverged, it would have tugged our universes even further apart. So they tried to find the subtlest ways to send a message."
p2344
aS'Saying things without changing hardly anything. Tweaking the note, the video. Pulling us back from the dead-end of the crawlways. Nudging us away from the red herrings closer to the surface, to deeper explorations.'
p2345
aS"Toward the new way through they'd discovered. A flooded tunnel, buried deep. A way to get us back home."
p2346
aS"I think about that a lot. We were their monsters. But they helped us anyway. Maybe they didn't see any other choice, but still. That was pretty great of them."
p2347
aS"Once they'd found the flooded connection, they could pass through to our home universe, and help clear the way back for us. Leave guide ropes. Make it easy."
p2348
aS'One of them stayed to keep an eye on us, to make sure we "discovered" the flooded tunnel.'
p2349
aS"Once we did, the plan was probably that they'd swim back through in advance, so that, when the time came, all four of us could pass each other, and the two of us could keep holding onto the thread of belief that synchronicity wasn't broken."
p2350
aS'At least until we were all in the right place again and what we believed no longer mattered.'
p2351
aS"But then that other Niko crept up from the depths of possibility and fucked everything up. They didn't see that coming, I don't think. How could they have?"
p2352
aS"Your counterpart, the other Niko from the twin universe---he didn't make it. _I always kill the Nikos first_. Well. That's what happened. I saw a finger, and I think, I'm guessing, you found a body."
p2353
aS"I can't even imagine what that must have been like. But that's why you thought the plan was fucked, that synchronicity was going to collapse the moment we survivors confronted the fact that only one Niko was left."
p2354
aS"Elder Niko's plan was to take his place, but without him, there was a gap. A flaw in the pairing. And based on everything we knew, you were sure it was a fatal one. It almost was."
p2355
aS"Who knows how much of this the other Ryan figured out. I guess all he knew is that his Niko never came back. He must have been scared, confused. Maybe that's why more of the Sham-Friends went for him. Maybe it wasn't coincidence."
p2356
aS"So that's my theory. Probably wrong. I'm sure you have your own.\n\nI guess the details matter less than how we left things."
p2357
aS"It feels like too late and too little to say I'm sorry, but I am. I was lost back then, too afraid to grow up and too wounded to risk being wounded again. But that's not a good enough excuse. I should have been more honest with myself."
p2358
aS"I should have been more honest with you. I wasn't, and I hurt you, and I can never pay you back for that."
p2359
aS"I am enclosing ten bucks, though, for the drink you bought me that night at the Russian dance club, lest you think I'm a total mooch. I did say I'd get you back, didn't I?"
p2360
aS"Thinking back on it all, I do take some comfort that when push came to shove, we choose to save each other rather than turn our backs. Or maybe it wasn't a choice: that wasn't how it felt to me. We just did it."
p2361
aS'You saved me, on the bedroom tube above that awful void, and other times besides, when you had every reason to leave me behind.'
p2362
aS"And I gave you the last of my air, not because I didn't want to lose you, but because you were the one who deserved it. That other Niko said it's too bad we don't get what we deserve."
p2363
aS"But deserving's just another story we tell ourselves, you know? And sometimes, if we try real hard, we can tell it right."
p2364
aS'I should wrap this up. If I spend all day writing mysterious letters to another man, my boyfriend might get jealous.'
p2365
aS"Adam. That's his name. Adam."
p2366
aS"Maybe it's ridiculous to think something as tiny as a triple-bagged USB key wrapped in a ten-spot could possibly find its way to you. If our two universes connect at all any more, it's far down in knotted skeins, hopelessly tangled."
p2367
aS'I imagine this baggie winding its way through miles of piping, tumbling down moss-covered tunnels, floating through submerged, warped bedrooms. Somehow making its way back up to another surface, another flood. Seems silly.'
p2368
aS"But I see it in my head, vivid. I try to believe there's a world where it could reach you, even though the odds seem astronomical."
p2369
aS"On the other hand, with so many possibilities down there, maybe it's inevitable."
p2370
aS'Maybe this message will multiply, splitting off into thousands of fractal copies, a million USB keys floating to a million surfaces, ending up in the hands of a lot of confused people but also, too, in yours.'
p2371
aS'Maybe one of those versions will even seem right to you. Irrational, but true.'
p2372
aS"I haven't dreamt about you in years, but I did last night. Not in particulars. Your name just sort of floated through me, troubling in some way but not defined. A word repeated until it loses its meaning, becomes obsessed with itself."
p2373
aS"A reflection's reflection. It's why I came by the old house, but all that was here was a flooded yard. All it reflected was me."
p2374
aS'I never knew what we were to each other back then. Something less than all those things we never were, but more than a friendship. An else-ship, maybe. An other-ship. Traces of mingled shrapnel under shared skin.'
p2375
aS'Broken pieces of each other we tried to make our own.'
p2376
aS"I guess we're left with what we had. _Have._ Definitely have, yeah? Because we're gone to each other, but not dead. We survived."
p2377
aS'So hey. I hope you\'re doing all right and you found your way back to a world where people say "fourd" like God intended. I hope you found better people to hang out with and a new set of hobbies and someone to appreciate your fashion sense.'
p2378
aS"I hope you realized you were someone worth saving, too.\n\nI miss you sometimes, but that's okay."
p2379
aS"We made it. And I think... I think we'll be alright."
p2380
aS'Nah. Scratch that.\n\nI trust we will.'
