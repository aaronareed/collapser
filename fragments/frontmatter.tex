The book you're holding is unique. There is no other exactly like it.

Each printing of \textsc{Subcutanean} is different. This is the one and only version generated from seed SEED_NUMBER. Words, sentences, or whole scenes may appear in this printing but not in others, or vice versa. No two copies are alike.

But all of them are the same story, more or less. Don't worry about what's in the other versions. It doesn't matter. This is the one that's happening to you.

This is the one you have.  
% This is the one that has you.
